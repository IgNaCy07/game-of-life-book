\chapter{Computer Searches}\label{apx:sat}

Many of the small Life patterns that are used repeatedly throughout this book were found via computer searches. Computational techniques are not really the focus of this book, but here we provide a brief overview of some particularly simple and effective techniques and programs that can be used to solve non-trivial Life problems.

\section{Brute Force and Integer Linear Programming}\label{sec:ilp}

One standard difficult problem that is encountered in Life is that of running the game backwards (i.e., finding a parent of a given pattern). One particularly simple (but slow) method of solving this problem is via brute-force: just test every single pattern composed of cells within the Moore neighborhood of the given pattern and see if any of them are a valid parent of that given pattern.

However, this search for a parent can be sped up considerably by rephrasing the problem in a way that lets us make use of already-developed (i.e., not specific to the Game of Life) search software. One approach is to use \emph{integer linear programming}, which is a well-studied method of searching for a set of integers satisfying some given linear inequality constraints. Since this method is so widely applicable across computer science, there are algorithms known for solving these types of problems that are much faster than na\"{i}ve brute force [CITE], and there are freely-available software packages that implement these algorithms [CITE].

For our parent-finding problem, we can make use of integer linear programming by introducing a binary variable for each cell that touches the given pattern (where a value of $0$ corresponds to that cell being dead in the parent and a value of $1$ corresponds to it being alive in the parent) and requiring that...
