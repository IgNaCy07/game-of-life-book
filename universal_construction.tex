\noindent In the previous chapter, we learned that we can often stabilize unstable reactions (like the $31c/240$~reaction of Figure~\ref{fig:31c_240_reaction}, or the $17c/45$~reaction of Figure~\ref{fig:17c45_reaction}) by using them to create gliders, and then using those gliders to synthesize stabilizing components. In this chapter, we take this idea one step further and show that similar behavior can be achieved without the need for the initial unstable reaction---we can use gliders to create or move some component in the Life plane, while simultaneously moving or recreating those gliders so that they can be re-used.

We refer to these techniques as \emph{universal construction},\index{universal construction} and a pattern that implements them as a \emph{universal constructor},\index{universal constructor} with ``universal'' referring to the fact that they can build any Life pattern that is synthesizable via gliders.\footnote{Some patterns, like Gardens of Eden and the grandparentless pattern from Figure~\ref{fig:grandparentless}, cannot be synthesized by gliders.} Although most universal constructors only fire slow glider salvos, we know from Theorem~\ref{thm:p2_slow_salvo} that this is enough to implement arbitrary glider syntheses. Most useful universal constructors are built out of simple stable components like blocks, beehives, and eater~1s, so that it is relatively straightforward to synthesize them via gliders, and thus they can even be used to build copies of themselves.

\section{Gemini}\label{sec:gemini}\index{gemini}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% As our first illustration of the utility of universal computation...

% TODO: Describe the general shape of Gemini a bit better first? Spaceship that builds itself in front of itself.

We have seen the basic idea behind universal construction several times now, starting back in Section~\ref{sec:slide_guns}. By using a sliding block (or other small still life) as an elbow, we can fire gliders at any location in the Life plane, thus allowing a sequence of gliders to encode the construction or destruction of essentially any pattern (via the slow salvo techniques of Section~\ref{sec:slow_salvo}, for example).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Elbow Operations}\label{sec:gemini_elbow}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We already saw gliders salvos that push or pull a sliding block back in Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_movers}, as well as salvos that can be used to fire perpendicular gliders of either color in Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_reflectors}. We summarize those reactions that we will make use of in Figure~\ref{fig:gemini_glider_operations},\footnote{The names ``\texttt{FIRE WHITE}'' and ``\texttt{FIRE BLACK}'' used for two of these reactions just refer to the fact that they fire perpendicular gliders of opposite colors (the absolute color names do not matter).} noting that just these four operations are enough for us to be able to implement any unidirectional slow salvo of our choosing.% Footnote about only needing 3?

\end{figure}

By using some Herschel circuitry to create these glider configurations, we can straightforwardly construct the component displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:construction_arm} that takes an input glider on one of four different lanes and performs the corresponding operation on  the sliding block. This particular component uses some slightly old conduits like Silver reflectors (refer back to Figure~\ref{fig:silver_reflector}) rather than more recent conduits for two reasons: (1) it will be useful for us to have this component built entirely out of pieces like blocks and eater~1s (and unlike Snarks) that are ``simple'' to synthesize, and (2) the Gemini spaceship that we will construct out of this component was built before many of the more efficient conduits that we have explored.\footnote{For example, the Gemini spaceship that we will soon construct was built in 2010, whereas the Snark was found in 2013 and the syringe was found in 2015.}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\caption{An elbow-operation circuit, which takes a glider on one of four input glider lanes and as a result either pulls or pushes the sliding block (elbow), or uses it to fire a perpendicular glider of either color to the southwest. Note that all four actions require the \texttt{PULL} circuit to be activated, as it produces the frontmost pair of gliders in all four operations (see Exercise~\ref{exer:construction_arm_lanes_timed}). Constructed by Paul Chapman in 2004.}\label{fig:construction_arm}
\end{figure}

By aiming the output gliders of two of these elbow-operation circuits at each other, we can encode the construction of any glider-synthesizable pattern in the input streams (with the advantage that the input lanes are fixed, whereas the output lanes are not).\footnote{This is similar to how we encoded the synthesis of a $2$-engine Cordership in some glider sequences back in Figure~\ref{fig:armless_cordership_gun}.} For example, the pattern displayed in Figure~??...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The Spaceship Itself}\label{sec:gemini_itself}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Importantly, because these circuits are made up of such simple components (mostly blocks and eater~1s, with the most difficult piece to synthesize being a tub), they can even be used to synthesize copies of \emph{themselves}. Indeed, this is the key idea behind the Gemini spaceship: use an extremely long chain of gliders to have two of these circuits build copies of themselves somewhere else in the plane. To turn this idea into a \emph{spaceship} though (rather than just something that repeatedly builds copies of itself), we need to make two additions:\smallskip

\begin{itemize}
	\item[1)] We need to destroy the original pair of elbow-operation circuits after they have constructed the new ones. To do this, we simply use a third elbow-operation circuit, which is constructed alongside the original pair. After all three circuits are constructed, the first two start construction again while the third one starts destroying the old circuits. Since objects like blocks and eater~1s can easily be destroyed by a single glider each, it is straightforward to find a glider recipe that destroys the elbow-operation circuits.\smallskip
	
	\item[2)] We need to be able to re-use the glider recipes that store the construction and destruction recipes. Since we cannot use a static loop (we need the glider recipes to move along with the elbow-operation circuits), we instead have the glider recipes bounce back and forth between \emph{two} copies of the entire three-elbow-operation circuit that we have described.\footnote{In fact, the two ends of the spaceship that we construct will be exactly identical. This is the reason for its name ``Gemini''---it is Latin for ``twins''.}\smallskip
\end{itemize}

After we put all of these ideas together, we get the Gemini spaceship that is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:gemini}.\footnote{Constructed by Andrew J.~Wade in May 2010.} It builds a copy of itself displaced by 5,120 cells in one direction and 1,024 cells in the other direction every 33,699,586 generations, making it the first spaceship that we have seen that does not travel orthogonally or diagonally at a slope of~$1$ (its slope is $5120/1024 = 5$).

\section{Single-Channel Glider Synthesis}\label{sec:single_channel_synth}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Recall from Section~\ref{sec:slow_salvo} that slow salvo synthesis is a method of encoding the construction of a pattern in the positions of a sequence gliders, with their timing playing no role (except that the gap between consecutive gliders must be sufficiently large that each glider's collision must settle down before the next glider arrives). We now flip this idea around and instead show how to encode the construction of a pattern in the \emph{timing} of a sequence of gliders, with their \emph{position} playing no role. In particular, we show how to encode glider synthesis via gliders that are all coming from the same direction on the same lane.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{With a 90-Degree Elbow}\label{sec:single_channel_synth_90}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As with many of our other universal constructions, we make use of a block that acts as an elbow in order to make these single-lane syntheses possible. In particular, we fire a stream of gliders at a block so as to first create a chaotic explosion, and then clean up the resulting debris while creating a perpendicular glider. For example, Figure~\ref{fig:90_degree_first_example} displays a sequence of 13~gliders that, when it collides with a block, produces a single glider travelling in a different direction.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\patternlink{90_degree_first_example}{\vcenteredhbox{\includegraphics[width=0.486864\textwidth]{universal_construction/90_degree_first_example.pdf}} \vcenteredhbox{\color{black}{$\xrightarrow{\text{\clock{3}{3} 1186}}$}} \vcenteredhbox{\includegraphics[width=0.414736\textwidth]{universal_construction/90_degree_first_example_2.pdf}}}
	\caption{A sequence of $13$ gliders travelling along the same lane that collide with a block so as to (a) produce a single perpendicular glider, and (b) recreate the target block along the same lane (but shifted northwest by 20 half-diagonals) so that it can be re-used by other single-channel recipes. The numbers on the left indicate the number of generations between consecutive gliders.}\label{fig:90_degree_first_example}
\end{figure}

Since all gliders in a single-channel sequence like this come from the same direction on the same lane, we can encode it simply via the number of generations between each consecutive pair of gliders. For example, the $13$-glider sequence from Figure~\ref{fig:90_degree_first_example} could be encoded by the following sequence of $12$~timing gaps:
\begin{center}
	\texttt{109, 91, 94, 91, 91, 124, 91, 105, 90, 106, 112, 108}.
\end{center}

Computer searches have been carried out\footnote{Mostly by Simon Ekstr{\"o}m, with some optimizations by Dave Greene, in 2017.} to generate single-channel glider sequences that, when aimed at a block as in Figure~\ref{fig:90_degree_first_example} (i.e., so that the first glider triggers a block-to-pi-heptomino explosion), a single output glider is produced on some perpendicular lane. A summary of some reasonably short sequences of this type that produce gliders on a variety of different output lanes (and in either of the two perpendicular output directions) is provided in Table~\ref{tab:single_lane_90deg_glider_timings}.

\subsection{With a Zero-Degree Elbow}\label{sec:single_channel_synth_0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

While the single-channel syntheses of the previous subsection are very useful, it is sometimes desirable to use single-channel glider sequences to build an object directly in front of them, rather than off to their side. For example, it will be useful for us to be able to use gliders from a single lane to construct a Snark that accepts gliders on that same lane as input.

To make this possible, instead of using a 90-degree elbow, we use a \emph{zero-degree elbow}:\index{zero-degree elbow} a small stable object (like a block) that several gliders are fired at on a particular lane so as to produce a single glider going in the \emph{same direction} but on a different lane.\footnote{Here, ``zero-degree'' refers to the fact that the input glider stream is being ``reflected'' by zero degrees (i.e., not reflected at all, but just shifted to a different lane).} For example, Figure~\ref{fig:lane_8_0degree} displays a sequence of $14$~gliders that, when it collides with a block, produces a single glider going in the same direction, but shifted by $8$ lanes.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\patternlink{lane_8_0degree}{\vcenteredhbox{\includegraphics[width=0.4508\textwidth]{universal_construction/lane_8_0degree.pdf}} \vcenteredhbox{\color{black}{$\xrightarrow{\text{\clock{3}{3} 1440}}$}} \vcenteredhbox{\includegraphics[width=0.4508\textwidth]{universal_construction/lane_8_0degree_2.pdf}}}
	\caption{A sequence of $14$ gliders travelling along the same lane that collide with a block so as to (a) produce a single glider travelling in the same direction, but shifted up by $8$~lanes, and (b) recreate the target block along the same lane (but shifted southeast by 8 half-diagonals) so that it can be re-used by other single-channel recipes. The numbers on the left indicate the number of generations between consecutive gliders.}\label{fig:lane_8_0degree}
\end{figure}

As with $90$-degree single-channel sequences, we encode zero-degree single-channel sequences simply by the number of generations between each consecutive pair of gliders. For example, we encode the $14$-glider sequence from Figure~\ref{fig:lane_8_0degree} via the following sequence of $13$~timing gaps:
\begin{center}
	\texttt{109, 91, 94, 91, 91, 93, 90, 158, 90, 91, 90, 90, 116}.
\end{center}

% Talk about why it's more important to have a wide variety of lanes in this setting. Block move doesn't help as much as it did with 90deg
Once again, extensive computer searches have been used to generate single-channel glider sequences of this type that produce a single output glider on a wide variety of different lanes. A summary of sequences of this type for output lanes $-22$ through $+22$ is provided in Table~\ref{tab:single_lane_0deg_glider_timings}. There are numerous points of clarification that need to be made about these recipes:\smallskip

	\caption{Single-channel glider sequences that produce an output glider on a given lane (relative of the sequence itself, which is on lane~0). The ``move'' and ``timings'' columns are as in Table~\ref{tab:single_lane_90deg_glider_timings}.}\label{tab:single_lane_0deg_glider_timings}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Some of these glider sequences, like the ones that output lane~4 or 7, change the zero-degree elbow block into another small object like a boat, beehive, or pond. This is okay because those objects explode into a pi-heptomino when they are hit by a glider in the exact same way that a block does, and this is always the reaction that the first glider in these single-channel sequence triggers.\smallskip
	
	\item The ``move'' column of Table~\ref{tab:single_lane_glider_timings} specifies how many half-diagonals farther away the zero-degree elbow is moved by the glider sequence.\smallskip
	
	\item The value in the ``move'' column being odd means that the zero-degree elbow was moved to the other side of the input glider stream. If this happens, the output lanes of all subsequence glider sequences are flipped from positive to negative, and vice-versa. For example, the sequence corresponding to lane~2 has a ``move'' value of $-27$, which is odd. Thus if we want to output gliders on lanes $2$ and then $3$, we would have to send the sequences corresponding to lanes $2$ and then $-3$.\footnote{Since the ``move'' value for the lane~$-3$ sequence is also odd, the zero-degree elbow would then be back on its original side of the glider stream after this second sequence. See Exercise~??.}\smallskip
	
	\item In most of these glider sequences, there are numerous gaps of 90 and 91~generations. The reason for this is that we want to be able to feed these single-channel glider recipes through standard components like Snarks and the easy-to-synthesize Lx200-assisted\index{Lx200} syringe\index{syringe} from Exercise~\ref{exer:syringe_Lx200} (which has a repeat time of~$90$ generations).\footnote{Single-channel glider sequences with large timing gaps are desirable since they can make use of circuitry that has a higher repeat time. We could use sequences with gaps no smaller than $115$~generations (such sequences are known to be able to emulate arbitrary glider syntheses), thus letting us feed these sequences through the syringe variant from Figure~\ref{fig:syringe_modified}. However, as the minimum timing gap increases, so does the length of the resulting glider sequences, so we stick with a minimum timing gap of 90~generations.}
	
	Most of the gliders that have a timing of 90 or 91 generations could actually be moved much closer (i.e., the previous glider's collision settles down before they arrive) if we so desired. The reason that some gliders use a gap of $91$~generations instead of just $90$ is that their timing matters mod~$2$, due to p$2$ components like blinkers in an intermediate reaction.\smallskip
		
	\item Table~\ref{tab:single_lane_glider_timings} is not even close to exhaustive---there are tens of thousands of single-channel recipes of this type known for all output lanes from $-100$ to $+100$.\footnote{These recipes can be downloaded from \httpsurl{gitlab.com/apgoucher/slmake/-/tree/master/data/simeks}.} It can be useful to have multiple recipes for the same output lane, since they might move the zero-degree elbow by different amounts.\smallskip
\end{itemize}

Since these single-lane glider sequences move the zero-degree elbow forward and backward by some amount that we do not control (it is dictated by the lane that we wish the output glider to fire on), it is important to be able to move the elbow \emph{without} firing a glider as well. We typically do not care about its exact position, but we still have to make sure that it stays at least roughly where we want it (so it does not crash into an object that we are trying to synthesize, for example). The two elbow-moving sequences provided below, and displayed in Figure~??, take care of this task.

% TAlk about Gemini took 5 months to complete. Maybe earlier instead. Made with a custom computer script to make the glider recipe

The development of single-channel glider synthesis mostly took place in 2017, when a relative newcomer, Simon Ekstr{\"o}m, cavalierly disregarded accumulated prejudices from the previous decade, tried a search, and found that it worked.\footnote{This is not unlike when Andrew J. Wade built Gemini in 2010, or ConwayLife.com forums user ``zdr'' found the copperhead spaceship in 2016. In all of these cases, a newcomer simply looked where the members of the Life community thought there wasn't anything to find.} It was already known in 2015 how to emulate arbitrary glider synthesis via gliders on a single lane, and that technique was used by Chris Cain and Dave Greene to construct an earlier demonoid than the ones we presented in this chapter, called the \emph{0hd demonoid}\index{0hd demonoid} that year.\footnote{The ``0hd'' in the name of this demonoid refers to the fact that there are zero half-diagonals separating its gliders.} However, Ekstr{\"o}m was the first to show that it is possible even when the gliders are far enough apart from each other that they can be fed through components like Snarks and syringes.
% Talk about RCT here, and how it shows every glider-synthesizable object can be built wtih 17 far-apart gliders. This is referenced in Ch5 Notes section.

\begin{problem}\label{exer:construction_arm_lanes_timed}
	The elbow-operation circuit of Figure~\ref{fig:construction_arm} requires two synchronized input gliders to trigger each of the \texttt{PUSH}, \texttt{FIRE WHITE}, and \texttt{FIRE BLACK} operations---one to create the frontmost pair of gliders via the \texttt{PULL} circuit, and one to create the additional glider(s).
	
	Add additional Herschel conduits to that circuit so that each of the four operations can be triggered by just a single input glider.
