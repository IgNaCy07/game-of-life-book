\noindent We have seen that being able to efficiently create and manipulate streams of gliders is extremely important when constructing complex objects in Life, since we use collisions between these gliders to create other objects, and we often have to be careful to have appropriate spacing between the gliders. However, thus far we have only seen how to create glider streams with a few different spacings: the period~30 stream produced by the Gosper glider gun (Section~\ref{sec:queen_bee}), the period~46 stream produced by the twin bees gun (Section~\ref{sec:twin_bees}), and the streams of period~61 and higher than we can construct via the (typically very large) Herschel tracks of Sections~\ref{sec:herschel_track} and~\ref{sec:conduits}. In this chapter, we look at how to construct glider guns that create gliders of any spacing and almost any positioning that we like.

\section{Glider Deletion}\label{sec:glider_deletion}

The first technique that we present for constructing guns of different periods is one that erases every second glider in any stream of period at least~$29$, thus doubling its period (the semi-Snark\index{semi-Snark} of Section~\ref{sec:large_glider_guns} can similarly delete every second glider in a glider stream, but it only works at periods~$48$ and greater).\footnote{There is a similar reaction that can be used to double glider streams of period at least $28$---see Exercise~\ref{exer:p28_double}.} The way this technique works is to fire two streams of the same period at each other in such a way that they synthesize a block,\footnote{In particular, this glider collision is the fifth of the block-producing collisions listed in Table~\ref{tab:2_glider_synth}.} and that block then destroys the next glider in one of the streams. The particular orientation of the glider streams that works is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:glider_delete}, and we see that one of the glider streams is erased completely (half of its gliders are destroyed in the glider-to-block collision with the other stream, and half of its gliders are destroyed by the subsequent block), and the other glider stream has half of its gliders destroyed.
\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\caption{If we shoot two glider streams (of period at least $29$) at each other in the proper phase, one of the streams is destroyed completely while the other stream is thinned out by a factor of 2. This works because the gliders collide to form a block, and that block then destroys the next glider in the bottom stream, letting the next glider in the top stream pass by unharmed.}\label{fig:glider_delete}
\end{figure}

We can use this reaction to straightforwardly double the period of any glider gun with period~$29$ or higher, which we demonstrate in Figure~\ref{fig:guns_doubled_period} with the period~$30$ Gosper glider gun and the period~$46$ twin bees gun.\footnote{The gun in Figure~\ref{fig:guns_doubled_period}(a) is currently the smallest known period~$60$ gun, but a slightly smaller period~$92$ gun can be constructed by colliding two twin bees shuttles together directly in a certain way.} We can also iterate this procedure to create (rather large) glider guns with periods as large as we like, by doubling the spacing out the output glider stream as many times as we like.
\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{We can use two copies of any gun with period at least $29$ to create a gun with double the period. This is demonstrated in (a) with two period~$30$ Gosper glider guns creating a period~$60$ gun, and (b) two period~$46$ twin bees guns creating a period~$92$ gun. In each case, the individual guns are outlined in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua}, gliders that collide to create a block are outlined in \bgbox{yellowback2}{yellow}, and gliders to survive to create the new, thinner glider stream travelling to the southeast are outlined in \bgbox{greenpastel}{green}.}\label{fig:guns_doubled_period}
\end{figure}

We can thus use this technique to multiply the period of any glider stream (with period at least~$29$) by any power of two. However, what if we want to multiply the period by another number, such as $3$ or $5$? Well, we could simply try firing glider streams at each other in different ways and see if any of them do the trick---after all, we saw in Section~\ref{sec:2glidersynth} that there are only $71$ ways for two glider streams to hit each other, so it won't take too long to check them for useful combinations. And indeed, it turns out that a period-tripling configuration exists,\footnote{The collision we describe here is the third one listed in the ``misc'' section of Table~\ref{tab:2_glider_synth}.} as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:glider_delete2}.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\embedlink{glider_delete2}{\vcenteredhbox{\patternimg{0.09}{glider_delete2_0}} \vcenteredhbox{\genarrow{6}} \vcenteredhbox{\patternimg{0.09}{glider_delete2_6}} \vcenteredhbox{\genarrow{30}} \vcenteredhbox{\patternimg{0.09}{glider_delete2_36}} \vcenteredhbox{\genarrow{66}} \vcenteredhbox{\patternimg{0.09}{glider_delete2_102}}}
	\caption{If we shoot two glider streams (of period at least $34$) at each other in the proper phase, one of the streams is destroyed completely while the other stream is thinned out by a factor of ~$3$.}\label{fig:glider_delete2}
\end{figure}

The idea behind this mechanism is largely the same as it was in the collision in Figure~\ref{fig:glider_delete}, only slightly more complicated:\medskip

\begin{itemize}
	\item When the first gliders in the streams collide, they leave behind two blocks.\smallskip
	
	\item When the next gliders in the streams hit the blocks, the blocks are erased and a single blinker is left behind.\smallskip
	
	\item That blinker destroys the third glider in one of the streams, and the third glider in the other stream passes by unharmed.\medskip
\end{itemize}

\noindent The effect of firing two glider streams at each other in this way is thus to completely destroy one of the streams and thin out the other stream by a factor of~$3$. This reaction is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:p138_gun}, where we use two period~$46$ twin bees guns to create a period $3 \times 46 = 138$ gun (this reaction only works for glider streams of period~$34$ or higher, so we cannot apply it to the Gosper glider gun).
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\patternimglink{0.1}{p138_gun}
	\caption{We can use two copies of any gun with period at least~$34$ to create a gun with triple the period. This is demonstrated here with two period~$46$ twin bees guns creating a period~$138$ gun.

\end{figure}

Also, just like before, we can use this reaction repeatedly with more and more copies of the original gun, each time multiplying the gun's period by either $2$ or $3$, which lets us multiply the gun's period by any number whose prime factorization contains only those numbers. We can thus use this technique to thin out a glider stream by a factor of $4$, $6$, $8$, or $9$, for example (but recall from Section~\ref{sec:large_glider_guns} that we can use semi-Snarks to thin out a glider stream by any factor of our choosing). To fill in some of the gaps in this list, we present in Figure~\ref{fig:glider_delete_prime} some methods for thinning out a stream by a factor of $5$ or $7$.

\subsection{Filters}\label{sec:filters}\index{filter}

Another way of deleting some gliders within a stream is to use a \emph{filter},\index{filter} which is an oscillator that pulsates or gives off a spark in such a way as to destroy some of the gliders in the stream, but not all of them (similar to how we used a Schick engine to erase some of the gliders released by a space rake in Section~\ref{sec:schick_engine}). Gliders can be destroyed by essentially any type of spark (see Figure~\ref{fig:glider_delete_spark}), so we can use many sparkers (of appropriately large enough periods) to destroy gliders and thin out glider streams.

For example, if we place a period~$8$ blocker\index{blocker} next to a glider stream of period $8n+4$ $(n \geq 2$), it destroys every second glider in the stream, thus doubling its period. Similarly, the period~$16$ oscillator ``Rich's p16'' from Figure~\ref{fig:rich_p16} emits a banana spark that can be used to double the period of any glider stream with period $16n+8$ ($n \geq 1$), and the period~$22$ oscillator from Figure~\ref{fig:period_22} emits a domino spark that can be used to double the period of any glider stream with period $22n+11$ ($n \geq 1$). These period-doubling filters are illustrated for streams of period~$20$, $24$, and~$33$ in Figure~\ref{fig:glider_filters}.

\end{figure}
% Rob's p16 works same as Rich's but is smaller, see Exercise {exer:robs_p16_smaller_p16_gun}.

For a filter oscillator to work correctly, it's generally necessary that the period of the oscillator shares some factor (greater than one) with the period of the glider stream being thinned. Otherwise, all possible combinations of oscillator spark and glider position will eventually appear in the evolution of the pattern, and some of those combinations will usually cause a chaotic explosion instead of causing a glider to disappear cleanly.

\section{Glider Insertion}\label{sec:glider_insertion}

Our next technique is one that is complementary to that of the previous section: it lets us thicken up glider streams (i.e., it lets us decrease their period). The main idea behind this trick is to collide two gliders (or other objects) in such a way as to produce a single glider that is travelling in a different direction. Unfortunately, this technique in its simplest form is very rarely useful, since there are only two 2-glider collisions that result in a single glider (refer back to Table~\ref{tab:2_glider_synth}), one of which results in a glider going in the \emph{same} direction as one of the input gliders, and the other of which results in a glider going in the \emph{opposite} direction of one of the input gliders (and thus will crash into other gliders in the input stream). In particular, neither of these glider-producing $2$-glider collisions results in a glider travelling perpendicular to both input gliders, which is what we really want.

%	\caption{Two gliders can collide to reverse the path of one of them.}\label{fig:glider_flip}
%\end{wrapfigure}

Fortunately, there are a few other ways of colliding spaceships together to get around this problem. The first such method is to use one more glider: the $3$-glider collision called a \emph{tee}\index{tee} that we introduced back in Table~\ref{tab:3_glider_synth} produces an output glider that is perpendicular to all $3$ input gliders (see Figure~\ref{fig:tee}).\footnote{An alternate ``tee'' reaction is presented in Exercise~\ref{exer:herschel_tee}.} Another such method is to instead collide a glider with a lightweight spaceship as in Figure~\ref{fig:lwss_reflect_glider}, which has the advantage that an LWSS never travels in the same direction as a glider, so we typically have a wider selection of possible orientations to make the collision happen without interfering with other gliders in the stream.

These techniques help us create glider guns with a wide variety of periods, and are also extremely useful for creating guns that make use of syntheses with tightly-spaced gliders.}\label{fig:glider_insert_methods}
\end{figure}

These collisions can be used to insert additional gliders into an already-existing glider stream, thus decreasing its period. For example, the glider gun displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p23_gun} uses the LWSS--glider collision to insert additional gliders into a period~$46$ glider stream combing from a twin bees guns, thus converting it into a period~$23$ gun (compare with the period~$23$ gun that we saw back in Figure~\ref{fig:twin_bees_p23_gun}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]

	\patternimglink{0.1}{p23_gun}
	\caption{A period~$23$ glider gun constructed from several period~$46$ glider guns. The top-left glider gun in \bgbox{magentaback}{magenta} fires a period~$46$ stream of gliders. To interlace this stream with another period~$46$ stream of gliders (outlined in \bgbox{greenpastel}{green}), we use the LWSS--glider collision of Figure~\ref{fig:lwss_reflect_glider}: the glider in that collision is created by the glider gun outlined in \bgbox{yellowback2}{yellow}, while the LWSS is created by the LWSS gun (which we introduced in Figure~\ref{fig:twin_bees_p46_lwss_gun}) outlined in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua}.}\label{fig:p23_gun}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, the ``tee'' from Figure~\ref{fig:tee} cannot be used to produce glider streams of period below~$25$, and the LWSS--glider collision from Figure~\ref{fig:lwss_reflect_glider} can only produce streams of period down to~$22$; the temporary debris created by these collisions interferes with the rest of the glider stream at lower periods. So for example, these reactions cannot be used to transform multiple Gosper glider guns into a period~$15$ gun, despite the fact that period~$15$ glider streams are indeed possible.

One way of constructing guns for even tighter glider streams (all the way down to period~$14$, which is the smallest possible) is to instead use the reaction displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:lwss_squish}(a), which uses two sparks to transform a lightweight spaceship into a glider with essentially no debris occurring outside of that transformation.\footnote{This reaction was found by Dietrich Leithner no later than 1994.} The first of these sparks (which can be of essentially any type, but is typically a dot, a finger, or a domino coming from a pipsquirter)\index{pipsquirter} starts destroying the lightweight spaceship and can typically be provided by a suitably-chosen oscillator. The second spark (which must be a domino or duoplet) then transforms the dying LWSS into the desired glider. However, that second spark is a bit tricker to get into place, as it must be provided directly adjacent to the glider stream, so it is typically provided by another dying object like an LWSS or a Herschel. Some methods of providing these two sparks are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:lwss_squish}(b--f).

To illustrate the utility of this reaction, we can now construct a period~$15$ glider gun by making use of several copies of the p$30$ Gosper glider gun, much like we constructed a period~$23$ glider gun out of many copies of the p$46$ twin bees gun in Figure~\ref{fig:p23_gun}. In particular, since the reaction of Figure~\ref{fig:lwss_squish} works so naturally at period~$15$, we make use of it via $7$ Gosper glider guns: $1$ to create the initial p$30$ glider stream, and $3$ for each of the two lightweight spaceships that we smash together between a pentadecathlon and middleweight volcano. The completed p$15$ gun is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p15_gun}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Streams of Other Spaceships}

Since most ways of implementing the glider insertion reaction of Figure~\ref{fig:lwss_squish} rely so heavily on the use of lightweight spaceships, we now briefly discuss how to efficiently create and manipulate lightweight (as well as middleweight and heavyweight) spaceships. We of course can create streams of these spaceships simply via the various $3$-glider syntheses that we saw in Chapter~\ref{chp:glider_synthesis}, but we are going to focus on reactions that let us save space over this na\"ive method.

On particularly cheap way of creating lightweight and middleweight spaceships is the conduit displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:H_plus_G_to_WSS}, which converts a glider and a Herschel into whichever of the other two spaceships is desired (the only difference in these two reactions is the relative timing between the input Herschel and glider). Since the Herschel that is used in that collision creates a glider anyway, and that glider can simply be reflected back so as to collide with the next Herschel, this conduit can turn a Herschel stream into an LWSS stream or an MWSS streamreasonably directly.\footnote{This reaction only works with \emph{streams} of Herschels, rather than individual Herschels, since each Herschel must collide with the first natural glider of a Herschel that came before it. The period of that stream can be modified straightforwardly by adjusting the reflectors---see Exercise~\ref{exer:p156_adjust_lwss}.} However, the tight spacing of the required reflectors is such that this technique works best for streams whose period is a multiple of $3$, since p$3$ and p$6$ bumpers are some of the only reflectors that fit so close together.

\end{figure}

To create a reasonably small lightweight or middleweight spaceship gun of a large period, we can now simply attach this mechanism to the output of any sufficiently high-period glider gun of our choosing, with a syringe in between (as well as another Herschel conduit or two for spacing reasons). For example, the gun in Figure~\ref{fig:p84_lwss_gun_both}(a) uses this technique to fire a period~$84$ stream of lightweight spaceships. However, since this mechanism uses a stream of Herschels as input, we can often construct even smaller LWSS guns by attaching it directly to a Herschel track rather than to a gun and syringe. Another (slightly smaller) period~$84$ LWSS gun of this type is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p84_lwss_gun_both}(b).

%With a minimum repeat time of 100 gens the reaction is not very fast.

%%   SUBSECTION: GLIDER GUNS OF ANY PERIOD
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Glider Guns of Any Period}\label{sec:glider_gun_any_period}

We have already seen a few methods of constructing glider guns of any suitably large period of our choosing---we can use Herschel tracks as described in Sections~\ref{sec:herschel_track} and~\ref{sec:conduits} to create guns of any period~$62$ or greater, the adjustable-period glider gun of Figure~\ref{fig:p80_adjustable_gun} to create guns of any period~$80$ or greater, and the period multipliers of Section~\ref{sec:large_glider_guns} to create guns with extraordinarily large periods. However, none of those methods can create a glider gun with very small period, like~$14$.

By making use of the glider insertion reaction of Figure~\ref{fig:lwss_squish}, we can now fill in this gap in our knowledge and construct glider guns of all periods~$14$ and greater---we just create a gun whose period is a suitably large multiple of the period that we actually want, and then repeatedly use multiple copies of this gun and the glider insertion reaction to fill in the gaps in its glider stream.\footnote{The first period~14 glider gun was built by Dietrich Leithner in November 1994 using these same ideas (and the same glider insertion reaction).} For example, to create a period~$14$ gun, we could use Herschel tracks to construct a gun of period~$14 \times 5 = 70$ to create a p$70$ glider stream, and then use multiple copies of that gun to do glider insertion $4$ times between each pair of gliders in that stream. However, the resulting p$14$ gun would be quite large---recall that creating a p$15$ gun required \emph{seven} p$30$ guns in Figure~\ref{fig:p15_gun}, and they just performed a single glider insertion.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\patternimglink{0.134}{p14_pieces_p84}
	\caption{A p$84$ gun that emits $2$ out of $3$ gliders in a p$28$ stream. The central Herschel is fed through NE30T3 (highlighted in \bgbox{greenpastel}{green}) so as to create two output gliders, one of which is reflected (via standard reflectors like bumpers, bouncers, and Snarks, highlighted in \bgbox{yellowback2}{yellow}) into the same lane as the other one. The first natural glider of the central Herschel is similarly reflected and then injected into a syringe (highlighted in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua}) so as to recreate itself (just as in the gun from Figure~\ref{fig:p84_lwss_gun_both}(b)).}
	\label{fig:p14_pieces_p84}
\end{figure}

In order to construct a somewhat smaller p$14$ glider gun using these same ideas, we instead use a period~$14 \times 6 = 84$ stream as our starting point, as there are some useful devices (like the syringe) that can be made to work at period~$84$ but not~$70$. It is straightforward to construct a period~$84$ glider gun using the adjustable-period gun of Figure~\ref{fig:p80_adjustable_gun}, for example,\footnote{In fact, we already did this in Figure~\ref{fig:p84_lwss_gun_both}.} but if we are slightly more clever then we can actually build a gun that places \emph{two} of the six gliders that we need to bring a p$84$ stream down to p$14$. In particular, if we use one of the Herschel-to-multiple-glider edge shooters of Figure~\ref{fig:herschel_to_glider_edge}, we can then reflect one of its other output gliders so as to be on the same output lane as the glider that was shot from the edge of the conduit. Figure~\ref{fig:p14_pieces}(a) illustrates one way of using this idea with the NE30T3 conduit to construct a p$84$ gun that emits $2$ out of every $3$ gliders in a p$28$ stream.\footnote{By rearranging the reflectors in this gun slightly, its period can be adjusted relatively straightforwardly---see Exercise~\ref{exer:p28_adjust_29}.}

By making use of these reactions, we can create the period~$14$ glider gun displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p14_gun}. Despite its large size, it is only about 50\% larger than the smallest p$14$ gun that is currently known.\footnote{When measured according to bounding box area. When measuring according to population, the gun from Figure~\ref{fig:p14_gun} is roughly tied for smallest known.} Furthermore, that smallest known p$14$ gun makes use of all the same mechanisms, just packed together somewhat more cleverly.

The glider insertion mechanisms works via the reaction from Figure~\ref{fig:lwss_squish}(d), which is fed by the p$84$ LWSS gun of Figure~\ref{fig:p84_lwss_gun_both}(b) and a Herschel that is generated by another copy of the same p$84$ Herschel loop.}\label{fig:p14_gun}

\section{True-Period Guns}\label{sec:true_period_guns}

While we now know how to construct glider guns of every period greater than or equal to $14$, many of them are somewhat artificial---many of these guns themselves oscillate at a higher period than (and necessarily a multiple of) the stream that they produce. For example, the gun of Figure~\ref{fig:p15_gun} actually oscillates at period~$30$, despite producing a glider stream of period~$15$. Such guns are called \emph{pseudo-period guns}\index{pseudo-period gun}, and all of the new low-period guns that we introduced in this chapter are of this type.

While there is nothing inherently wrong with pseudo-period guns, it seems natural to ask whether or not we can construct guns of arbitrary periods that actually oscillate at the same period as their stream (i.e., guns that do not make use of techniques like glider insertion to decrease the period of the stream that they produce). We call such guns \emph{true-period guns}\index{true-period gun}, and examples include all of the guns that we saw prior to this chapter, such as the p$30$ Gosper glider gun\index{Gosper glider gun} and the p$46$ twin bees gun\index{twin bees gun}.

In general, using glider insertion to decrease the period of a gun's stream results in a pseudo-period gun, but using filters or the glider deletion methods of Section~\ref{sec:glider_deletion} to \emph{increase} the period of its glider stream results in a true-period gun (e.g., the p$60$ gun from Figure~\ref{fig:p60_gun} that uses two Gosper glider guns is a true-period gun). Constructing true-period guns with small period\footnote{Herschel tracks can be used to create true-period guns of large period (period~$62$ and larger, in particular).} is much more difficult than the same task for pseudo-period guns, since we cannot just manipulate gliders themselves to get the period we desire, but rather must actually develop new glider-generating mechanisms.

There are just a few ad-hoc methods that are known for creating true-period glider guns, and they only work for a few select periods. A brief summary of the known true-period guns of these few periods is presented in Table~\ref{tab:true_period_glider_gun}, and the next few subsections illustrate and describe the construction of these guns.\footnote{Unfortunately, it probably will not be long before this list of true-period guns becomes out of date ($5$ new periods were discovered while this book was being written!), so a perhaps more up-to-date list of known true-period gun periods can be found at \httpsurl{conwaylife.com/wiki/Gun} and \httpsurl{conwaylife.com/wiki/LifeWiki:Game_of_Life_Status_page\#Glider_gun_true-periods}.}

\subsection{Spark Collisions: True-Period 22, 30, 33, 36, 45, and 46 Guns}\label{sec:true_period_spark}

Most of the simplest true-period glider guns work simply by having sparks from different oscillators collide with each other in such a way as to create a glider. In fact, the very first guns to be discovered---the p$30$ Gosper glider gun\footnote{Technically, the Gosper glider gun does not work by colliding \emph{sparks}, since the colliding debris would form a beehive if left uninterrupted, rather than dying. Nonetheless, the idea behind it is the same.} and the p$46$ twin bees gun---are of this type. The next simplest true-period glider guns have periods~$22$ and~$45$, and are similarly of this type.

The true-period~$45$ gun displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p22_45_guns}(b) works by colliding the sparks of a custom period~$45$ oscillator with the edge of a pentadecathlon, so that their interacting sparks create a glider. Similarly, the true-period~$22$ gun displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p22_45_guns}(a) works by positioning two copies of the very sparky Jason's~p$22$ oscillator (refer back to Figure~\ref{fig:period_22}) next to each other. Unfortunately, no filter is capable of doubling the period of this gun (see Exercise~\ref{exer:p4_glider_filter}) and none of the other glider deletion techniques that we discussed earlier work at period~$22$, so it is not clear whether or not this gun can be easily modified to create a true-period~$44$ gun. However, will see a different method of making a true-period~$44$ gun shortly, in Section~\ref{sec:true_period_hassler}.

\end{figure}

There are also glider guns of periods~$33$ and~$36$ that are mostly of this type---they work by colliding together large sparks from two copies of very sparky oscillators of periods~$33$ and~$36$, respectively. However, these guns also require a few extra stabilizing components to clean up the glider-producing reaction. For example, the period~$36$ oscillator in Figure~\ref{fig:p36_gun_both}(a) can be paired up with itself to create the true-period~$36$ gun in Figure~\ref{fig:p36_gun_both}(b), but it requires an extra heavyweight emulator to clean up a block that is left behind by the sparks otherwise, which would destroy the gun between the first and second glider that it creates.

\end{figure}

Similarly, the period~$33$ oscillator in Figure~\ref{fig:jasons_p33} can be paired with itself, once we remove the boat and tub that stabilize it on one end, to create the true-period~$33$ gun in Figure~\ref{fig:p33_gun}. However, an extra eater~1 is needed to help produce the output glider, and a custom period~$3$ oscillator is needed to clean up the reaction so that the gun is not destroyed after it creates its first glider.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Hasslers: True-Period 20, 24, 40, 44, 48, 50, and 59 Guns}\label{sec:true_period_hassler}

Quite a few true-period guns work by hassling a commonly-occurring unstable object like a T-tetromino or pi-heptomino, much like the oscillators that we saw back in Section~\ref{sec:hasslers}. The difference here is that the hassling reaction has to be chaotic enough that a glider can be extracted from the debris that it produces.

For example, we can construct true-period~$20$, $24$, $40$, and~$48$ glider guns by using the T-tetromino hassling reactions that we introduced back in Figure~\ref{fig:t_tetromino_hasslers}. In particular, notice that the period~$24$ oscillator from Figure~\ref{fig:p24_t_tetromino_hassler} emits a large and somewhat long-lasting spark near its bottom-right corner---if we could hit this large spark with another spark just right, it seems believable that a glider might be formed.\footnote{This line of thinking led Bill Gosper to guess that a gun would be made from his p$24$ T-tetromino oscillator within about $24$~hours. It turned out to be trickier than he expected though, and actually took a bit longer than $2$~years to complete.} It turns out that there is indeed a (somewhat complicated) combination of sparks that works to collide two T-tetrominoes together to give us what we want, and the resulting true-period~$24$ glider gun is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p24_glider_gun}. Since we can use Rich's p16 to double the period of period~$24$ glider streams as in Figure~\ref{fig:richs_p16_glider_filter}, this also gives us a true-period~$48$ glider gun almost for free.

\end{figure}

By using the same T-tetromino collision, together with the p$20$ hassling reaction from Figure~\ref{fig:p20_t_tetromino_hassler}, we also get a true-period~$20$ glider gun for not too much extra effort. The biggest hurdle to overcome when constructing the p$20$ gun is the fact that there is so much going on in such a small space that it is difficult to generate the necessary sparks without the sparkers overlapping with each other. One configuration that works is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p20_glider_gun}. It is worth noting that this is the smallest-period true-period glider gun that is currently known. Furthermore, we can use a blocker to filter this p$20$ stream as FSince we can use Rich's p16 to double the period of period~$24$ glider streams as in Figure~\ref{fig:blocker_glider_filter} to quickly and easily turn this into a true-period~$40$ gun.

The period~$44$ pi-heptomino\index{pi-heptomino} hassler from Figure~\ref{fig:p44_pi_hassler} is similarly the basis of all known true-period~$44$, $50$, and~$59$ glider guns. For example, the true-period~$44$ glider gun works simply by replacing one of the blocks (which are used to suppress the debris from the pi-heptominoes) on the side of the oscillator with a custom conduit that converts that debris into a glider. This conduit consists of a block and two eater~1s,\footnote{The third eater~1 is not part of the conduit, but just replaces one of the other stabilizing blocks for spacing reasons.} and the resulting gun is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p44_glider_gun}.\footnote{The first true-period~$44$ glider gun was found by David Buckingham in 1992. He then found this smaller version in October 1996.}

\end{figure}

By swapping out the heavyweight emulators on the sides of this reaction for an arrangement of two blocks and blinker, its period increases to $50$~generations, but with the disadvantage that the blinker is pushed away by one cell when the debris hits it, so it needs to be pushed back if it is going to form part of a viable oscillator or gun. There are a number of sparks that can push the blinker back, perhaps the simplest of which comes from a collision of $3$ queen bees. The resulting glider gun is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p50_glider_gun}. However, there is one problem: this gun is pseudo-period, not true-period, since the queen bees oscillate at period~$30$ and thus the whole gun oscillates at period~$150$ (not period~$50$).

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\patternimglink{0.1}{p50_glider_gun}

The reaction pushes the blinker away by $1$ cell, so some queen bees (highlighted in \bgbox{magentaback}{magenta}) are used to push it back. As before, the conduit that transforms the pi-heptomino debris into a glider is highlighted in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua}.}\label{fig:p50_glider_gun}
\end{figure}

To turn this gun into a true-period gone, we need a mechanism for pushing back the blinkers that oscillates at period~$50$ (or a divisor of $50$). One such mechanism is the p$50$ traffic jam\index{traffic jam} oscillator from Exercise~\ref{exer:traffic_jam}. Unfortunately, this mechanism is rather large and thus, to prevent the glider-generating conduit from colliding with the traffic jam oscillator, we have to use \emph{two} copies of the p$50$ pi-heptomino hassling reaction as well, so that rather than having the form

\begin{center}
	queen bees -- blinker -- pi-heptominoes -- blinker -- queen bees,
\end{center}

\noindent as it did in Figure~\ref{fig:p50_glider_gun}, the true-period~$50$ glider gun (displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:true_p50_glider_gun})\footnote{This gun is a slightly smaller version of the first known true-period~$50$ glider gun, which was found by Dean Hickerson just one day after David Buckingham found the small p$44$ gun in 1996.} has the larger form

\begin{center}
	traffic jam -- blinker -- pi-heptominoes -- blinker -- pi-heptominoes -- blinker -- traffic jam.
\end{center}

\noindent Note that this gun can be made somewhat smaller by cleverly using a glider to stabilize one side of the pi-heptomino reaction (see Exercise~\ref{exer:p50_glider_stabilize}).

To prevent the conduit (highlighted in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua}) from colliding with the middleweight volcanoes, we have to use two copies of the pi-heptomino reaction (highlighted in \bgbox{yellowback2}{yellow}) rather than just one. As before, a special configuration of blocks and blinkers is used between the different p$50$ components, and is highlighted in \bgbox{greenpastel}{green}.}\label{fig:true_p50_glider_gun}
\end{figure}

Finally, this pi-heptomino hassling reaction can also be extended to period~$59$ by carefully hitting it with gliders. In particular, the reaction displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p59_glider_reaction} features two copies of the pi-heptomino reaction and converts  $5$ input gliders into $6$ output gliders every $59$ generations (two of the output gliders are created via the same conduit as in the period~$44$ and~$50$ guns, and the other four gliders are produced at the center where the two copies of the pi-heptomino reaction meet each other).\footnote{This reaction was found by Jason Summers in December 2009.}
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\patternimglink{0.1}{p59_glider_reaction}
	\caption{A period~$59$ reaction that takes in $5$~gliders (highlighted in \bgbox{greenpastel}{green}) and spits out $6$~gliders (highlighted in \bgbox{magentaback}{magenta}). The reaction works by using two copies of the pi-heptomino reaction (highlighted in \bgbox{yellowback2}{yellow}) to create two gliders via a conduit (highlighted in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua}) and four more gliders when the debris from these reactions collide with each other at the center. Since it emits more gliders than it destroys, it can be used to construct a period~$59$ glider gun.}\label{fig:p59_glider_reaction}
\end{figure}

The reason that this reaction can be used to create a gun is that it produces more gliders than it destroys---we simply need to redirect $5$ of the output gliders back into the appropriate input positions so as to continuously fuel the reaction, leaving the $6$th output glider as the output of the gun. The smallest-known true-period~$59$ glider gun that can be constructed via this method is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:p59_glider_gun}, and it uses Snarks (as well as some of the welded Snarks) to reflect most of the output gliders from this reaction right back into itself, thus ``fueling'' the creating of the single excess glider.\footnote{The first true-period~$59$ gun used the same reaction and was also built in December 2009, by Adam P. Goucher. Since the Snark had not yet been discovered, it used (very large) reflectors based on Herschel tracks instead, and had more than $300 \, 000$ live cells.}

	\caption{A true-period~$59$ glider gun that was constructed by ConwayLife.com forum user ``Entity Valkyrie'' in October 2018. It works by using two copies of the $5$-to-$6$ glider reaction from Figure~\ref{fig:p59_glider_reaction} (outlined in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua}) and several Snarks to bounce the output gliders of those reactions back into themselves (the tracks that the gliders follow are highlighted in \bgbox{yellowback2}{yellow}, \bgbox{greenpastel}{green}, and \bgbox{magentaback}{magenta}).}\label{fig:p59_glider_gun}
\end{figure}

It is worth noting that the top half of this gun is almost identical to its bottom half, and only exists to take care of the two troublesome glider streams that are positioned so close to each other near the center of the gun. Snarks (and all other known reflectors that work at period~$59$) are too large to reflect one of those glider streams without interfering with the other one, so instead a second copy of the reaction is used so that those two tight glider streams feed each other's reactions.


\subsection{Quetzals: True-Period 52, 54--58, and 61 Guns}\label{sec:true_period_guns_p57}

The remaining known true-period guns are all based on Herschel tracks, but they make use of custom (typically oscillating) components to overcome the fact that a Herschel's first natural glider will collide with a Herschel following behind it by fewer than $62$~generations, and thus cannot be used as the output of the gun. A gun of this type is called a \emph{quetzal}\index{quetzal} or \emph{quetzalcoatlus}\index{quetzalcoatlus|see {quetzal}} after the giant flying pterosaur, in reference to the fact that these guns are typically extremely large due to the limited components that we have to build the tracks. In contrast, oscillators of this type (such as the period~$56$ one from Figure~\ref{fig:period_56_herschel}) are called \emph{emus}\index{emu}, in reference to the fact that they are ``flightless'' (they do not emit any gliders).

There are two key ideas that let quetzals work: we can use custom components to extract gliders from Herschels \emph{other} than their first natural glider, and we can use periodic components to decrease the repeat time of some conduits by eating a Herschel's first natural glider before it has a chance to collide with the subsequent Herschel. Some custom conduits that implement the first of these ideas (glider extraction) at some low periods are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:fx77_extract}, and some additional methods of performing this same task are presented in Exercise~\ref{exer:fx77_extract_other_osc}. We note that this glider extraction technique, as well as the other upcoming conduit modifications based on oscillators, is applied to the Fx77 Herschel conduit since it has a much lower repeat time than most other known conduits, and thus is easier to get working at these low periods.

\end{figure}

For the second idea (decreasing a conduit's repeat time), there is a variant of eater~$5$ that can be used to eat a first natural glider quickly enough to let two Herschels follow each other by as little as $57$ generations. In fact, this is exactly why Fx77's repeat time is $57$ generations---the first natural glider is its limiting factor. There are also some sparkers that are good enough at eating gliders to allow Herschels to follow each other every $52$, $54$, $55$, or $56$ generations (such components could theoretically exist to allow for gaps of $51$ or $53$ generations as well, but no examples are currently known, and as a result no true-period guns of period~$51$ or~$53$ are currently known). These various fast eaters are displayed on the Fx77 conduit in Figure~\ref{fig:fx77_fast_eaters}.

\end{figure}

One final component that is extremely useful in these low-period situations is \emph{Jormungant's G-to-H}\index{Jormungant's G-to-H},\footnote{Found by Louis-François Handfield, who goes by the online pseudonym ``Jormungant'', in April 2018.} which is the conduit displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:2G_to_H} that quickly converts two gliders into a Herschel. While a syringe (refer back to Figure~\ref{fig:syringe}) has a repeat time of $78$~generations, which is too large for our purposes here, this two-glider variant of it uses a second glider to clean up some of the glider-to-Herschel reaction, resulting in a significantly smaller repeat time of just~$47$ generations (assuming that the first natural glider of the output Herschel can be erased quickly enough to allow for such a low repeat time). The downside of this conduit, however, is that it requires two input gliders rather than just one---it is a 2G-to-H conduit rather than just a G-to-H.\index{2G-to-H}

\end{figure}

With these mechanisms in hand, we are now in a position to construct true-period glider guns with periods $52$, $54$, $55$, $56$, and $57$---see Figure~\ref{fig:quetzals}. In particular, we use Jormungant's G-to-H to create a Herschel, which we move along a track via periodic conduits that quickly clean up its first natural glider so as to not disturb the next Herschel, and we extract three gliders from this Herschel: two that will be reflected back into Jormungant's G-to-H, and one that becomes the output of the gun. Since each of the periods that we now tackle have small prime factors, we can implement these reactions via the low-period conduits that we saw earlier (for example, $56 = 2^3 \times 7$, so the period~$56$ gun can make use of p$4$, p$7$, and p$8$ components).

These guns all work by using Jormungant's G-to-H (highlighted in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua}) to create a Herschel, which is fed along a track of Fx77's and oscillators to eat its first natural gliders faster than stable components can (as in Figure~\ref{fig:fx77_fast_eaters}, highlighted in \bgbox{magentaback}{magenta}).

	\label{fig:quetzals}
\end{figure}

The only remaining periods that are currently known to be attainable by true-period guns are $58$ and $61$. However, these periods are somewhat more challenging to construct guns for than the previous periods due to not being divisible by any of the periods for which we have periodic Herschel conduits (like $4$, $5$, $6$, $8$, and $9$). For this reason, we must entirely make use of stable components, and the only Herschel conduits that have repeat time low enough to function at these periods are Fx77 ($57$~generations), L112 ($58$~generations), L200 (see Exercise~\ref{exer:name_conduit}(d)---$59$~generations), and R64 ($61$~generations).

To extract a glider from a Herschel track made up of these conduits, we make use of two reactions---one that uses an extra glider to duplicate a Herschel on the track, and then another one that turns that extra Herschel into two output gliders (see Figure~\ref{fig:H_G_reacs_58_61}). It is important that \emph{two} gliders are produced from that duplicated Herschel so that one of them can be used to fuel the earlier Herschel duplication reaction, and the other can be used as the output of the gun.\footnote{It is worth comparing these conduits with the Herschel transceivers from the ``Notes and Historical Remarks'' section of Chapter~\ref{chp:stationary_circuitry}; sometimes it is easier or quicker to send a tandem glider pair rather than individual gliders.}\index{tandem}

\end{figure}

One slight issue that arises with these particular reactions is that the two output gliders are very close to each other, so it is difficult to separate them. We saw some similar conduits that convert a Herschel into multiple (more easily separated) gliders back in Figures~\ref{fig:herschel_to_glider} and~\ref{fig:herschel_to_glider_edge}, but they all have repeat times of higher than $61$ generations and thus cannot be used in this setting. One method that \emph{does} work at period~$61$ and higher to separate these closely-spaced output gliders is to reflect one of the gliders off of the corner of an L112 conduit as a Herschel passes by.\footnote{This method does not work at period~$60$ or lower---see Exercise~\ref{exer:p61_gun_reflection_no_60}.} Using this trick lets us construct the true-period~$61$ glider gun displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p61_gun}.\footnote{First first true-period~$61$ gun was found by Luka Okanishi in April 2016. The smaller gun displayed here was constructed the next day with the help of Chris Cain.}

That Herschel is then converted into two gliders via the conduit of Figure~\ref{fig:H_to_2G_quick} (highlighted in \bgbox{orangeback2}{orange}), one of which becomes the output of the gun and the other of which is reflected by the other copy of the p$61$ Herschel track (highlighted in \bgbox{greenpastel}{green}) back around to fuel the Herschel-generating reaction.}\label{fig:p61_gun}
\end{figure}

This same technique can be used to construct a period~$58$ true-period glider gun, but the details are somewhat messier for a few reasons. First, we no longer have access to the R64 or L200 conduits (their repeat times are $61$ and $59$, respectively), so we must construct all Herschel tracks out of Fx77 and L112 conduits only. The smallest such track whose length is a multiple of the desired period of $58$ makes use of $4$ copies of L112 and $68$ copies of Fx77, for a total length of $(4 \times 112) + (68 \times 77) = 5,684$ generations. Placing $5684/58 = 98$ Herschels on this track results in the period~$58$ oscillator displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p58_herschel_track} that we can extract a glider from.

\end{figure}
% Earlier: in p58 construction exercise, solution just refs here

The second issue that is somewhat messier to deal with in this period~$58$ case is that the method we used to reflect a glider (and thus separate the two closely-spaced streams) in Figure~\ref{fig:p61_gun} does not work at period~$58$. We thus must use a different method of separating those two streams, and one method that works is to use a rephaser\index{rephaser} as in Exercise~\ref{exer:rephaser}. In particular, using two rephasers puts enough space between those streams that we can fit a Snark in between them, and from there we can inject one of those gliders back into the Herschel track just like we did in the p$61$ gun. The resulting true-period~$58$ gun is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p58_gun},\footnote{This gun was found by Matthias Merzenich and ConwayLife.com forum user ``thunk'', just one day after the p$61$ gun.} and it completes our collection of known periods with true-period guns.

\section{Slide Guns}\label{sec:slide_guns}

Now that we know how to construct glider streams with essentially any spacing of our choosing, we switch focus a bit and ask how we can reposition those gliders so that a single gun (or group of guns) can create gliders traveling on a wide variety of different lanes. The simplest way to accomplish this task is to use an \emph{elbow}\index{elbow}, which is a small and simple still life (typically a block) or constellation (like a honey farm)\index{honey farm} that can be moved to any point in the Life plane by gliders, and which can also turn gliders.

We already saw several different ways of using gliders to move a block around the Life plane when we investigated slow-salvo synthesis back in Section~\ref{sec:slow_salvo_blocks}. However, those recipes can be made slightly more efficient if we do not require them to be slow---that is, if we allow subsequent gliders to collide with the block before the reaction from the previous gliders settles down. For example, we can push a block diagonally away by $1$~cell via just $3$~synchronized gliders, whereas we required $6$~gliders in a slow salvo to achieve the same result back in Figure~\ref{fig:block_move_6_gliders}. Some reasonably simple block-moving recipes of this type are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_movers}.

There are similarly numerous ways of colliding gliders with blocks so as to create a glider traveling perpendicularly to the input gliders, without destroying (but potentially moving) the block. A brief selection of glider-reflecting reactions of this type are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_reflectors}. It is worth comparing these reactions with the one-time turners that we saw in Section~\ref{sec:slow_salvo_turners}---the key difference here is that the block is not destroyed during the reflection. In fact, that reactions in parts~(e) and~(f) of Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_reflectors} explicitly make use of one-time turners: a the first three gliders move the block and create a boat which is used as a one-time turner (and thus destroyed).\footnote{We first saw that a boat can be used as a one-time turner in Exercise~\ref{exer:boat_one_time_turner}.}

	\caption{Some ways of colliding gliders coming from one direction with a block so as to produce a glider traveling perpendicularly. The block is not destroyed, but it may be moved---it can then be moved back, if desired, by the reactions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_movers}. Reactions (e) and (f) were found by Paul Chapman in 2004 and make use of the same first two gliders as the block mover from Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_mover_4}. Their final glider can be delayed by any amount, and the output gliders of these two reactions have opposite colors.}\label{fig:synchronized_block_reflectors}
\end{figure}

Reflection reactions of this type are particularly useful as they let us use guns along just a finite number of lanes to create gliders traveling along any lane of our choosing, without the need for permanent fixtures like Snarks or glider guns in the locations of those lanes. For example, if we use one glider to shift a block as in Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_mover_1} and then two more gliders to shift a block and reflect a glider as in Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_reflector_1}, then the result is that the block is moved a total of $3-1=2$~cells right and $4-2=2$~cells down (i.e., perfectly diagonally) and a single glider is output in a perpendicular direction. By repeating this reaction (by producing those $3$ input gliders via glider guns, for example), every perpendicular glider is released $4$ lanes farther away than the one that came before it. We call the resulting gun a \emph{slide gun}\index{slide gun}, and one example is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:slide_gun}.\footnote{The first slide gun was constructed by Dietrich Leithner in July 1994. It made use of the reaction from Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_reflector_4} (see Exercise~\ref{exer:2_lane_slide_gun}).}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\patternimglink{0.11}{slide_gun}
	\caption{The glider highlighted in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua} moves the southeastern block and then the two gliders highlighted in \bgbox{magentaback}{magenta} and \bgbox{greenpastel}{green} move it and create a perpendicular glider. The total resulting movement of the block is $2$~cells southeast, so this \emph{slide gun} fires gliders on infinitely many different lanes (highlighted in \bgbox{orangeback2}{orange}). The three constituent p$120$ glider guns each consist of the p$60$ gun from Figure~\ref{fig:p60_gun} together with a blocker to filter its output (and some buckaroos to reposition their glider streams).}\label{fig:slide_gun}\index{buckaroo}
\end{figure}

Numerous other slide guns and variants of slide guns can also be created by combining these block-moving and glider-reflecting reactions in various ways. For example, the reaction from Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_reflector_4} can be used to create a slide gun that has gliders separated by $2$ lanes instead of $4$ (see Exercise~\ref{exer:2_lane_slide_gun}), and we could even create a ``slide gun'' that doesn't slide at all by choosing a block-moving combination of gliders that returns the block to its initial position after reflecting a glider. One possible way to achieve this effect is to use a total of $7$~gliders: the reflection from Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_reflector_1} followed by the move of Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_mover_1} and then the move of Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_mover_4} twice (see Exercise~\ref{exer:slide_gun_no_slide}).

We can even perform different block-reflecting operations like this in sequence. For example, we could create a slide gun that fires \emph{two} gliders on each of its output lanes by using a $10$-glider recipe: $7$~gliders to create a perpendicular glider without moving the block, and then $3$~more gliders to create another perpendicular glider while moving the block down and to the right. The resulting ``double'' slide gun is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:double_slide_gun}---it is made up of $10$~glider guns (instead of just $3$ like the regular slide gun from Figure~\ref{fig:slide_gun}), and due to the tight arrangement of $10$ gliders that it must fire, it makes heavy use of the glider-insertion technique that we saw back in Figure~\ref{fig:lwss_reflect_glider}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\patternimglink{0.107}{double_slide_gun}
	\caption{A slide gun that fires two gliders on each of its output lanes. The numerous p$240$ guns that make up this slide gun are each the same as the p$120$ guns from Figure~\ref{fig:slide_gun}, but with Rich's p$16$ attached to filter the output. The $10$ gliders used in the block-pushing recipe consist of two copies of the single-glider block mover from Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_mover_1} (highlighted in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua}), two copies of the two-glider block mover from Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_mover_4} (highlighted in \bgbox{greenpastel}{green}), and two copies of the two-glider reflector from Figure~\ref{fig:synchronized_block_mover_1} (highlighted in \bgbox{magentaback}{magenta}).}\label{fig:double_slide_gun}
\end{figure}

Theoretically, this method could be used to create any sequence of gliders appearing on any sequence of lanes of our choosing, though the details become increasingly cumbersome as the desired pattern of output gliders increases in complexity. We will return to this topic in Chapter~\ref{chp:universal_construction}, where we show how to use these ideas to build a pattern that can create copies of any pattern that can be synthesized by gliders (including itself).

% Earlier: give note that periodic reflectors like buckaroo are preferable over Snarks in some situations since they reflect at their edge (if this is not already mentioned)

\section{Armless Construction}\label{sec:armless}

It is very useful to be able to fire gliders along arbitrary lanes via guns that work on just a fixed set of lanes, and the block-pushing reactions of the previous section give us one way of doing so. However, perhaps a simpler way of achieving the same effect is to collide antiparallel gliders with each other so as to create a perpendicular glider. We saw that this can be achieved via the ``tee''\index{tee} collision of Table~\ref{tab:3_glider_synth} and Figure~\ref{fig:tee}, but those reactions require us to be able to generate input gliders on $3$ different lanes, including two lanes that are quite close together. In fact, since a given tee reaction always produces gliders of the same color, we'll need two separate tee reactions and a total $6$ different lanes if we want to generate perpendicular gliders of both colors.

Luckily there is a known component that converts a single Herschel signal directly into a pair of gliders that can be used in an alternate three-glider tee reaction. This means that we won't need three loop guns to produce three gliders.  Instead we can have each glider in a loop gun generate a glider pair using this H-to-2G component. Another gun can produce the corresponding antiparallel gliders.

% Move {exer:herschel_tee} illustration to here. A monochrome armless sample seems worth covering in the main text, just as a preview of how universal constructors will generally need different recipes for different glider colors.

This method of generating gliders is particularly useful for implementing slow salvo syntheses.\footnote{Slow salvo synthesis was explored in Section~\ref{sec:slow_salvo}.}\index{slow salvo} If we want to create a gun that implements any given slow-salvo synthesis, we could use numerous carefully-placed high period-guns (many of which will have to be edge shooters). But an easier way would be to encode the slow salvo synthesis in a two pairs of (quite large) loop guns, one pair for each glider color. This method of implementing a slow salvo synthesis is called \emph{armless}\index{armless construction} construction, in contrast with \emph{armed} construction\index{construction arm} that uses a block (or other still life or constellation) to position the slow gliders as in Section~\ref{sec:slide_guns}.

Unfortunately, slow-salvo syntheses of even moderately-sized objects like Corderships tend to require hundreds of gliders, so huge and unwieldy loop guns would needed to generate those syntheses. However, if we are willing to use $2$-direction slow syntheses instead, then we can synthesize a $2$-engine Cordership via just $17$ pairs of gliders.\footnote{In particular, we make use of the seed for the $2$-engine Cordership that we constructed in Exercise~\ref{exer:2_engine_corder_seed}.}

These are \emph{slow glider pairs}\index{slow glider pairs}, meaning that the action of each pair is completely independent from all pairs before it. The two gliders in each pair have to be precisely synchronized with each other, but an arbitrarily long delay can be added between any two pairs of gliders. This is a very useful feature when the glider production mechanism has a significant speed limitation, as we'll see in the next section.

Each of the two salvos contains gliders of both colors, so we'll have to include two pairs of loop guns  similar to the gun from Figure~\ref{fig:p80_adjustable_gun} that duplicates whatever gliders are placed on its track. Each pair of guns will be dedicated to producing all the gliders of one color. The above $17$ slow glider pairs can be created by a total of $8$~loop guns containing a total of $68$ gliders. For each output glider in each salvo, two gliders are added to one of the pairs of guns, depending on the output glider's color.  The result is the $2$-engine Cordership gun displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:armless_tee_cordership_gun}.

% The tee-based armless Cordership gun is posted here:
%    https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=85842#p85842for each output glider in each salvo, 

A tee reaction can be a convenient component in many situations where a slow salvo or a synchronized salvo must be generated. If a salvo of gliders takes up too many lanes, then a conventional edge shooter may not have enough clearance to place a glider in one of the central lanes, from either side of the salvo. A tee reaction can reach across any number of lanes, as long as the three gliders don't interfere with gliders that have already been placed in the salvo.

\subsection{Multicolor Armless Construction}\label{sec:multicolor_armless}
It's a little awkward to have to use a separate pair of loop guns to generate each of the two glider colors. It means there are more glider streams to maintain, and additional constraints come into play because one of the glider colors has to cross the construction area for the other glider color, where the tee collisions are occurring. In future chapters we will come across situations where it's much better to keep the number of individual signal storage loops to a minimum.  So the question arises:  is there a way to encode both colors of output glider into a single pair of loop guns?

There is in fact a known way to do this. We can use slow antiparallel glider collisions that only make use of $2$ gliders at a time, always arriving from the same two antiparallel lanes. This gives us the maximum amount of flexibility in storing the gliders in loop, and extracting copies. We only need to ensure that the time between adjacent gliders is at least the repeat time of the circuitry used to build the loop. For many syringe-based reflectors and splitters, this minimum repeat time is 74 ticks.

The simplest known reactions of this type are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:armless_tee}, and they make use of $3$ antiparallel $2$-glider collisions to generate an output perpendicular glider of either color. Slowing down the input gliders in one half of these reactions by $8n$ generations (i.e., moving them backward by two full diagonal steps) will move the output glider in that direction by $2n$~lanes, or one full diagonal. So we can use these two $6$-glider recipes to create an output glider on any perpendicular lane of our choosing.

\end{figure}

The wonderful thing about not having to worry about the timing between the glider pairs in these reactions, and only having to use a single lane, is that we can now use just two loop-based guns to generate any slow-salvo recipe we might want. For example, if we want to create a gun that cycles between firing gliders on four consecutive lanes, we first figure out which $4 \times 3 = 12$ antiparallel glider pairs we need to fire at each other, and then we place those pairs into two loop guns that are aimed at each other.\footnote{This is the same method that we used in Section~\ref{sec:p46_ticker_tape} to create ticker tapes.} In particular, for each output glider that we wish to generate, we first choose which collision from Figure~\ref{fig:armless_tee} we should use based on the color of that glider, and then we delay the $3$ gliders on one half of that collision by $8$~generations ($2$ full diagonals) at a time until the output glider is produced in the correct lane. The resulting gun is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:armless_4_lane_gun}.

A tee-reaction armless design has a lower total population (only two stored loop gliders per output glider) and consequently a faster repeat rate.  To change the output lane it's only necessary to move a single glider by 2N cells diagonally; to change the output glider's timing we simply delay or advance the two paired gliders in two connected loop guns.

Multicolor armless designs have other compensating advantages besides the smaller number of loops. Interleaving different colored gliders becomes relatively trivial, with no need to worry about gliders from the back pair of guns interfering with the forward guns' insertion reaction (or vice versa). The paired streams can be reflected into place with just plain Snarks if needed, and they're ambidextrous, if that's ever useful:  swap the glider triplets to the opposite guns, and the glider will fire in the opposite direction. A tee-reaction setup can't do that.

Thus, choosing one of these mechanisms over the other has some definite implications about priorities. If overall simplicity is more important for a given project, then it might make sense to use three glider pairs to insert each glider. The conduit that creates two gliders for the tee reaction is not something we know how to build easily, especially with slow salvos, so it wouldn't be a reasonable part of any circuitry that must itself be constructed by gliders. But it's very easy to assemble Spartan circuitry that puts simple pairs of gliders on two opposing lanes. 

The biggest advantage of armless construction is that the general form of the gun would not significantly change if we instead wanted the gun to synthesize a completely different spaceship like a loafer or an ecologist.  All that we would have to change is the sequences of gliders running through the glider loops. This trick of encoding patterns in sequences of gliders, rather than in the positions of various complicated guns, will be extremely useful once we investigate universal construction in Chapter~\ref{chp:universal_construction}.

We have now seen four different explicit constructions of a gun that fires $2$-engine Corderships: we saw how to use its $9$-glider synthesis to construct such a gun ``directly'' in Exercise~\ref{exer:2eng_corder_gun}, we saw how to transform a glider into a $2$-engine Cordership (and thus any sufficiently high-period glider gun into a $2$-engine Cordership gun) in Figure~\ref{fig:glider_to_2engine_cordership}, and two different ways of using armless construction to fire $2$-engine Corderships using loop guns are shown above.

\section{Slow and Irregular Guns}\label{sec:irreg_guns}

We have spent most of this chapter looking at methods of constructing fixed-period guns with evenly spaced output. We now switch gears slightly and construct some guns that fire gliders more and more slowly, thus giving us our first examples of patterns with sub-linear (but non-zero) growth rates.


\subsection{Sqrtguns}\label{sec:sqrt_gun}

One method of creating a gun that gets slower and slower is to use a Herschel and/or glider track that gets longer and longer. This can be achieved by making use of the block-pushing reaction that we saw back in Figure~\ref{fig:block_pusher}---every time the $3$~input gliders hit the block it is pushed farther away, thus increasing the time that it takes for the next $3$~input gliders to hit the block. If we can feed the $2$~tandom output gliders into a circuit that recreates the $3$~input gliders and also creates an output glider for the gun to fire, we will be done.

Fortunately, this is a relatively straightforward exercise involving the circuits that we have seen. We can convert the tandem gliders from the block-pushing reaction into a Herschel via the Herschel receiver that we saw in Figure~\ref{fig:herschel_transceiver}. That Herschel can then be converted into $4$~gliders via stable conduits like the ones that we saw in Section~\ref{sec:glider_to_herschel}, and $3$~of those gliders can be redirected back toward the block so as to start the process all over again. The resulting pattern is a gun that emits each glider $80$~generations more slowly than its previous one, so its $n$-th glider is released in a generation that is asymptotically proportional to $n^2$ (specifically, in generation $40n^2 + 2029n - 969$). Such a gun is called a \emph{sqrtgun}\index{sqrtgun} (pronounced ``squirt gun'', in reference to the fact that its population in generation~$t$ is asymptotically proportional to $\sqrt{t}$), and one example is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:sqrtgun}.\footnote{The first sqrtgun was constructed by Dean Hickerson sometime around 1991.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Caber Tossers and Logarithmic Growth}\label{sec:log_growth}

We now construct a gun that fires gliders even more slowly than a sqrtgun. The idea that we now use is to bounce a glider back and forth between a receding spaceship and a stationary object that reflects and duplicates the glider. Because the spaceship gets farther and farther away, the time that it takes for the bouncing glider to make a round-trip and get duplicated increases by some multiplicative factor every loop (rather than by some additive factor, as in sqrtguns), so the resulting growth rate is logarithmic.

Such guns are called \emph{caber tossers}\index{caber tosser}, and the simplest ones to construct make use of a single glider bouncing off of the back of a Cordership (after all, we already saw how to bounce gliders off of the back of Corderships in Figure~\ref{fig:cordership_reflections} and Exercise~\ref{exer:2_engine_cordership}, for example). The only somewhat tricky part of their construction is the object that duplicates and reflects the bouncing glider back toward the Cordership. We saw several conduits that could carry out this task in Chapter~\ref{chp:stationary_circuitry}, but we will instead make use of a periodic circuit that is somewhat smaller. In particular, we aim one glider gun in the correct positioning and timing as to be reflected by the receding Cordership, but we place another glider gun so as to block it. Then we just fiddle with the timing and spacing until we find a configuration in which the returning glider blocks the blocking stream,\footnote{This configuration can easily be found by hand---recall that roughly one third of all two-glider collisions result in the gliders destroying each other, and those are what we want here.} thus letting a single glider from each stream escape and repeat the process. One configuration that works is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:caber_tosser}.\footnote{The first caber tosser was built by Dean Hickerson in May 1991 using this same arrangement of guns, but it used a slightly different glider reflection involving the larger 13-engine Cordership instead of the 2-engine Cordership.}

	\caption{A \emph{caber tosser} with logarithmic growth rate. A period~$60$ glider gun (highlighted in \bgbox{greenpastel}{green}) fires gliders at a 2-engine Cordership (highlighted in \bgbox{yellowback2}{yellow}) to be reflected back, but is blocked by a period~$30$ glider gun (highlighted in \bgbox{orangeback2}{orange}). When the triggering glider (highlighted in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua}) blocks \emph{this} stream, it allows a single glider through from both guns and thus restarts the process. Since the Cordership is constantly moving away from the guns, the round trip taken by the triggering glider takes longer and longer (in fact, exactly twice as long each time) so the output gliders have logarithmic spacing. In (b), the spacings between objects are to scale, but the objects themselves have been magnified.}
	\label{fig:caber_tosser}
\end{figure}

For this particular caber tosser, the bouncing glider takes twice as long to make a round trip every time a glider is released, so each glider takes twice as long to be released as the one before it. In particular, its $n$-th glider is released in generation $480 \times 2^n - 727$, so its growth rate is logarithmic (i.e., its population in generation~$t$ is asymptotically proportional to $\log(t)$).\footnote{All logarithms that we consider are base-$2$ (however, it does not matter what base we use in this particular case).}


\subsection{Recursive Filters and Slower Growth Rates}\label{sec:recursive_filter}

Now that we know how to create patterns that grow logarithmically, it seems natural to ask: ``how slow can you grow?'' That is, are there patterns that grow even slower than logarithmically, and is there an asymptotically slowest-growing pattern? The answers to these questions are ``yes'' and ``no'', respectively, and they both follow from the existence of devices that can be attached to the output of a glider gun so as to create an asymptotically slower glider gun.

One such device is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:recursive_filter}.\footnote{Constructed by Alexey Nigin in July 2015.} This object is called a \emph{recursive filter}\index{recursive filter}, and when it receives a glider from whatever gun is attached to its input\footnote{The input glider must be aligned to period~$120$. The caber tosser from Figure~\ref{fig:caber_tosser} thus works fine for generating input to this recursive filter, but if we wanted to use the sqrtgun from Figure~\ref{fig:sqrtgun}, for example, then we would have to insert a universal regulator in between (see Exercise~??).} (typically a slow gun like a caber tosser, but ``standard'' guns work fine too), it releases a pair of lightweight spaceships to the east. Then one of three things happens:\smallskip

\begin{itemize}
	\item[1)] If this was the first pair of lightweight spaceships to be released, they hit the sparks at the back of the unnamed $c/3$ eastbound spaceship, creating a loaf.\smallskip
	
	\item[2)] If a loaf is present in the path of the lightweight spaceships, they collide so as to pull the loaf westward (i.e., closer to the recursive filter) by $6$~cells.\index{tractor beam}\footnote{This loaf-pulling reaction is called a \emph{tractor beam}, and it can be used to create many other patterns with strange growth rates---see Exercise~\ref{exer:sawtooth}.}\smallskip
	
	\item[3)] If the loaf has been pulled all the way back to the recursive filter, it is destroyed and the filter then releases a single glider.\smallskip
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\patternimglink{0.11}{recursive_filter}
	\caption{A \emph{recursive filter} that receives input gliders from a gun that is aligned to p$120$ and emits output gliders much more slowly. The guns highlighted in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua} on the left create a stream of LWSS pairs that are blocked by the gun central gun highlighted in \bgbox{magentaback}{magenta}, and similarly the p$120$ gun highlighted in \bgbox{yellowback2}{yellow} blocks the output gun at the southeast. When an input glider is received from the northeast, it blocks the magenta gun, thus letting a LWSS pair proceed to the east and collide with the unnamed $c/3$ spaceship highlighted in \bgbox{greenpastel}{green}, creating a loaf. Future LWSS pairs then pull this loaf westward so that the yellow stream is eventually blocked by that loaf, allowing an output glider (highlighted in \bgbox{orangeback2}{orange}) to escape to the southwest.}\label{fig:recursive_filter}
\end{figure}

% Picture is 480 gen offset from what is described here, needs to be fixed up

The result of this behavior is that if the $c/3$ spaceship is $2n$~cells away from the recursive filter when its first input glider releases the first pair of lightweight spaceships, they will make the first loaf about $12n$~generations later when the $c/3$ spaceship is $6n$~cells away. It will then take $6n/6 = n$ additional input gliders to pull that loaf back to the recursive filter, at which point its first output glider will finally be released.

For example, if we attach a caber tosser to this recursive filter then it takes $480 \times 2^{n+1} - 727$ generations for those $n+1$ total input gliders to come in, so it takes that same amount of time for the recursive filter to release its first output glider. In particular, it takes about $500$ generations for the first glider from the caber tosser of Figure~\ref{fig:caber_tosser} to release the recursive filter's first pair of lightweight spaceships, at which time the $c/3$ spaceship is $208$ cells away from the recursive filter. We thus expect the filter's first output glider to appear after $208/2 = 104$ additional input gliders come in, at approximately generation
\[
	480 \times 2^{104 + 1} - 727 \approx 1.947 \times 10^{34}.
\]
Indeed, we see in Figure~\ref{fig:recursive_filter_caber} that after $1\, 920$ generations the first LWSS pair has created the first loaf, which is $6 \times 104 = 624$ cells away, and the first output glider finally appears at exactly generation $19,471,113,219,505,603,606,989,361,234,575,175 \approx 1.947 \times 10^{34}$.

	\caption{If we use a caber tosser (highlighted in \bgbox{yellowback2}{yellow}) as input to a recursive filter (highlighted in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua}), the result is a gun that grows extraordinarily slowly. The first glider from the caber tosser creates a loaf (circled in \bgbox{redback}{red}) $624$ cells away from the recursive filter, thus requiring $624/6 = 104$ additional input gliders from the caber tosser before the first output glider is created on the path highlighted in \bgbox{orangeback2}{orange}---this takes more than $10^{34}$ generations.}\label{fig:recursive_filter_caber}
\end{figure}

To analyze when future gliders appear, we just focus on the asymptotic behavior of this recursively-filtered caber tosser. Using the same argument as in the previous paragraph, if the $c/3$ spaceship is $2n$~cells away from the recursive filter when the first pair of lightweight spaceships is released, it will take $\Theta(2^n)$ generations for the recursive filter to release its first output glider. However, during that time while we waited for the first output glider, the $c/3$ spaceship also moved out to a distance of $\Theta(2^n)$ cells away from the recursive filter. We thus now have to wait for the caber tosser to release $\Theta(2^n)$ more input gliders before the recursive filter releases its second output glider, which takes $\Theta(2^{2^n})$ generations. Indeed, the pattern in Figure~\ref{fig:recursive_filter_caber} doesn't release its second output glider until approximately generation
\[
	480 \times 2^{19471113219505603606989361234575175/6 + 1},
\]
which is a number with roughly $10^{33}$ digits---just writing down the decimal expansion of such a number would use more computer storage space than exists on the entire planet.

Repeating this argument, we see that the third output glider takes $\Theta(2^{2^{2^n}})$ generations to produce, and in general the $k$-th output glider takes
\[
	\raisebox{0.18cm}{$\displaystyle\Theta\Big($}\begingroup\color{gray}\underbrace{{\color{black}2^{2^{\cdot^{\cdot^{2^n}}}}}}_{\text{\color{gray}$k$ levels}}\endgroup\raisebox{0.18cm}{$\displaystyle\Big)$}
\]
generations to produce. It follows that the population of this pattern in generation~$t$ grows asymptotically more slowly than $\log(t)$, $\log(\log(t))$, $\log(\log(\log(t)))$, and so on (regardless of how many times the logarithm is composed with itself). Its exact asymptotic growth rate is $\Theta(\log^*(t))$, where $\log^*$ is the \emph{iterated logarithm}\index{iterated logarithm} that counts how many times the (base~$2$) logarithm must be applied to a number to get a result no larger than $1$:\footnote{Equivalently, $\log^*(t)$ is the number of levels needed in a power tower of $2$'s to get a result at least as large as $t$, just like $\lceil\log(t)\rceil$ is the number of times $2$ must be multiplied by itself to get a result at least as large as $t$.}
\[
	\log^*(t) =
	\begin{cases}
		0                  & \mbox{if } \quad t \leq 1, \\
		1 + \log^*(\log(t)) & \mbox{if } \quad t > 1.
	\end{cases}
\]

As if that weren't slowly-growing enough, we could even use recursive filters in sequence to create guns that fire gliders even more slowly. For example, if we attach a second recursive filter to the output of the gun from Figure~\ref{fig:recursive_filter_caber} (see Exercise~??), we get a pattern whose population in generation~$t$ is $\Theta(\log^{**}(t))$, where $\log^{**}$ is the \emph{doubly-iterated logarithm} that counts how many times the iterated logarithm $\log^*$ must be applied to get a result no larger than $1$:\footnote{To give a rough idea of how slowly this function grows, we note that if $t$ is an integer with a trillion digits then $\log^{**}(t) = 4$.}
\[
	\log^{**}(t) =
	\begin{cases}
	0                  & \mbox{if } \quad t \leq 1, \\
	1 + \log^{**}(\log^{*}(t)) & \mbox{if } \quad t > 1.
	\end{cases}
\]
This gun won't emit even a single glider until somewhere around generation~$2^{2^{\cdot^{\cdot^{2}}}}$, where there are roughly $10^{34}$ levels in that power tower.

% There *is* a slowest growth rate by bounding box, found by Goucher and Greene. O(sqrt(log(n)). Will be covered in Universal Computation chapter.

% Exercises: determine growth rate of (some filter attached to some gun) or determine when first/second glider leaves
% EXERCISE: Make pattern with growth rate O(t^3/2) or O(t log^*t) (both easy, just attach guns we made here to a G-to-rake conduit). Earlier exercise: make G-to-rake conduit


\subsection{Fermat Primes and Unknown Growth}\label{sec:unknown_growth}

We now go one step beyond constructing patterns that just grow slowly, and construct a pattern for which we do not even know whether its population grows without bound at all. That is, we construct a pattern whose population might tend to infinity as time goes on, or might stay bounded below some fixed value as time goes on, and we do not know how to distinguish between these two possibilities.

One way to construct such a pattern is to encode an unsolved mathematical problem into the evolution of the pattern. Since there are numerous unsolved problems involving prime numbers, we use the prime-number-generating gun that we constructed in Figure~\ref{fig:primer} as our starting point. For example, it is currently unknown whether or not there are infinitely many \emph{Fermat primes}:\index{Fermat prime} prime numbers of the form $2^n + 1$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer. In fact, the only known Fermat primes are $3$, $5$, $17$, $257$, and $65537$, corresponding to $n = 1$, $2$, $4$, $8$, and $16$,\footnote{It is known that if $2^n+1$ is prime then $n$ must be a power of $2$.} and it is known that these are the only Fermat primes below
\[
	2^{2^{33}} \approx 9.63 \times 10^{2,585,827,972}.
\]

In order to tweak the primer so that it computes just Fermat primes (rather than all primes), we can use the caber tosser. For example, we could use some p240 guns to destroy each LWSS that the primer outputs, but then aim the caber tosser so as to block those p240 guns, thus allowing lightweight spaceships corresponding to numbers of the form $2^n+1$ to pass (see Exercise~\ref{exer:construct_fermat_primer}).

However, the population of such a gun would still tend to infinity regardless of how many Fermat primes exist, since the primer itself continues to construct more and more Gosper glider guns as time goes on. In order to get around this problem, we rig this Fermat prime calculator to self-destruct if a sixth Fermat prime is ever found.\footnote{We could similarly use the twin prime calculator (instead of a Fermat prime calculator) that we constructed in Exercise~\ref{exer:twin_prime_gun}. However, there are currently hundreds of trillions of twin prime pairs known, so it would not be easy to make it self-destruct only when a new one is found.}\index{twin prime} In particular, in that case we have the calculator send a signal to the front of the primer that causes an explosion to block it from expanding any further.

One mild hiccup that arises when constructing such a pattern is that primer travels at a speed of $c/2$ to the north and to the east, so the ``self-destruct'' signal that we send cannot be a spaceship (recall from Section~\ref{sec:speed_limits} that no spaceship travels faster than this). Instead, we use wickstretchers\index{wickstretcher}\index{fuse} to create wicks along the sides of the primer, and we send the ``self-destruct'' signal in the form of a fuse burning through those wicks at a speed exceeding $c/2$. The resulting pattern, displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:fermat_primer}, makes use of the $4c/5$ fuse from Exercise~\ref{exer:4c5_fuse} and the beehive puffer/wickstretcher from Exercise~\ref{exer:beehive_puffer}. It grows without bound if there are only $5$ Fermat primes, whereas it has a bounded population otherwise.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\embedlink{fermat_primer}{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{glider_guns/fermat_prime.pdf}}
	\caption{A Fermat prime calculator that self-destructs and has bounded population if a sixth Fermat prime exists, but grows without bound otherwise. A caber tosser (highlighted in \bgbox{yellowback2}{yellow}) fires gliders at the lightweight spaceships that the primer creates corresponding to integers of the form $2^n+1$ (the LWSS corresponding to the Fermat prime $5$ is circled in \bgbox{redback}{red}). If that LWSS is present (i.e., $2^n+1$ is prime) then the glider is reflected and destroys one of the four tubs to its northeast (they are destroyed by the known Fermat primes $5$, $17$, $257$, and $65537$). If another Fermat prime is found, the glider goes through a glider duplicator (highlighted in \bgbox{magentaback}{magenta}) and ignites two $4c/5$ beehive wicks that are laid by beehive puffers (highlighted in \bgbox{aquaback}{aqua}). Those wicks eventually cause two extensible $c/2$ spaceships (highlighted in \bgbox{greenpastel}{green}) to explode, blocking the primer.}\label{fig:fermat_primer}
\end{figure}

For spacing and timing reasons, this particular pattern starts with the Fermat prime $5$ (not $3$), and gliders corresponding to the Fermat primes $5$, $17$, $257$, and $65537$ each destroy a single tub near the southwest corner of the pattern. If a sixth Fermat prime is ever computed, the resulting glider is fed into a glider duplicator that ignites both fuses and leads to the primer's self-destruction. However, such self-destruction will not happen until at least generation
\[
	120 \times 2^{2^{33}} \approx 1.16 \times 10^{2,585,827,975},
\]
so evolving this pattern via computer software is  not actually an effective method of checking whether or not a sixth Fermat prime exists.

While it is not possible to run this pattern long enough to see it self-destruct, we can force its self-destruction by manually erasing one or more of the glider-absorbing tubs at its southwest corner. If we erase all $4$ of those tubs, the glider corresponding to the Fermat prime $5$ almost immediately triggers the primer's self-destruction, whereas deleting a smaller number of tubs delays its self-destruction somewhat. If we remove just $1$ tub, the ``self-destruct'' fuse is ignited after roughly $8$~million generations (by the glider corresponding to the Fermat prime $65537$) and the primer finally stabilizes after roughly $21$~million generations.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Notes and Historical Remarks}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Many of the ideas discussed early in this chapter were investigated right from the early days of Life. For example, many of the glider deletion tricks of Section~\ref{sec:glider_deletion} were already known in the early 1970's and were used to create the same period~$60$ gun that we constructed in Figure~\ref{fig:p60_gun}---see Figure~\ref{fig:lifeline_v11}. Indeed, the idea of encoding information in gliders and then using collisions between gliders to encode logical operations was already well-established at that time, and many useful interactions of this type were simply found by hand.

Other than guns resulting from these simple glider logic tricks though, not many new guns were found after the p$30$ Gosper glider gun and the p$46$ twin bees gun that were known of by 1971. Bill Gosper made a p$1100$ gun sometime around 1984, Dean Hickerson constructed a p$94$ gun in 1990, Bill Gosper made a p$144$ gun in 1994 (see Exercise~\ref{exer:p144_gun_from_achim}), and by the early 1990's David Buckingham had constructed guns of period~$44$ and $136+8n$ ($n \geq 1$), mostly based on his early work with Herschel tracks. However, progress in this area was relatively stagnant until he revealed Herschel track technology in full in 1996, and most of the earlier guns were so large and unwieldy that they were made almost instantly obsolete at that time.

After Herschel tracks hit the mainstream, which allowed for the systematic creation of glider guns of arbitrary large periods, a collaborative effort among many Life enthusiasts between then and 2003 (initiated by Dietrich Leithner and Peter Rott, and mainly led by Jason Summers and Karel Suhajda) produced explicitly-constructed glider guns of all periods from $14$ to $1\, 000$. The guns in this collection have since been shrunk down considerably via newer technology like Snarks and syringes, and at least a few of them are typically updated whenever a new sparky oscillator is discovered (as long as that oscillator can be used as a filter or reflector, anyway).

% we make the p16 a bit smaller in Exercise {exer:robs_p16_smaller_p16_gun}

As a result of these repeated optimizations, most of the guns in this collection are now very cleverly and tightly packed---much moreso than the p$14$ gun that we constructed in Figure~\ref{fig:p14_gun}. Indeed, that gun had lots of empty whitespace that could be reduced by customizing the four glider insertion mechanisms that it uses, rather than using the exact same track for all four of them. For example, the current smallest known p$16$ gun (measured according to bounding box, which is $158 \times 158$) is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p16_gun}. This gun uses a small p$24$ glider gun (one that is slightly smaller and newer than the one we saw in Figure~\ref{fig:p24_glider_gun}), which is then filtered to p$48$ by Rich's p$16$, and then sped up to p$16$ via two copies of the glider insertion reaction from Figure~\ref{fig:lwss_squish_pip}.

This collection of small glider guns is now being maintained by Chris Cain and Dave Greene. Links to the up-to-date version of the collection can be found at \httpsurl{conwaylife.com/wiki/Dieter_and_Peter's_glider_gun_collection}.

		\item Use that conduit to build a smaller stable glider-to-LWSS converter than the one that we constructed in Figure~\ref{fig:glider_to_lwss_both}(b).
		
		[Hint: Be careful---do not use periodic reflectors like we did in Figure~\ref{fig:H_plus_G_to_WSS}, and make sure that the glider collides with the \emph{same} Herschel, rather than the \emph{next} one like in that figure.]

\begin{problem}\label{exer:p54_fold_corners}
	The p$56$ glider gun displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:p56_gun} uses three reflectors at its top and at its bottom, instead of just one, to make it bounding box slightly smaller. You can similarly ``fold in'' the top and bottom corners of some other guns to make their bounding boxes smaller.
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\bf\color{ocre}(\alph*)]
		\item Modify the p$54$ glider gun from Figure~\ref{fig:p54_gun} so that its bounding box has at at least $300$ fewer cells in it.

	Explain why the method of separating the two close glider streams in the p$61$ gun from Figure~\ref{fig:p61_gun} (by reflecting one of the gliders off of the corner of an L112 conduit) does not work at p$58$, p$59$, or p$60$, despite L112 having a repeat time of~$58$ generations.

\begin{problem}\label{exer:armless_basics}
	``Armless'' glider production is a useful and highly adjustable mechanism, but some adjustments have consequences that may not be intuitively obvious.
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\bf\color{ocre}(\alph*)]
		\item In a pair of loop guns that are connected to create an armless salvo, if two glider streams are identical in length and timing, what limitation does that place on the output salvo?
% SOLUTION: the gliders will be \emph{single-channel} -- limited to a single output lane. To get different output lanes, the streams of gliders in the two guns must have different timings.
		\item What behavior appears if you try to make output gliders with two loop guns with periods that are \emph{different} by a multiple of 8?
% SOLUTION: the output glider lane(s) drift in one direction or the other, eventually reaching and probably destroying one of the loop guns.
		\item Find a design for a "drifting armless-tee" gun that would allow multiple cycles of the above behavior but avoid the resulting problem.
% SOLUTION: One option would be to adjust the loop guns' periods to particular multiples of 8, so that there's some number P = N*{gun1 period} = (N+1)*{gun2 period}. Then add an additional period-P gun that suppresses one signal from gun #2, producing a period-P ``scanning'' or ``strobing'' effect.

\begin{problem}\label{exer:armless_tee}
	Tee reactions can be used to build simple unidirectional slow salvos, or even synchronized salvos.
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\bf\color{ocre}(\alph*)]
		\item Use the idea from Section~\ref{sec:armless} (separate loops for different glider colors) with the following period-387 loop gun ...

            to build an armless $4$-consecutive-lane shotgun like the one from Figure~\ref{fig:armless_4_lane_gun}, but with period 387.
        \item How can the shotgun from (a) be modified to allow the gliders to be placed at the minimum possible distance shown below? Create a new version of the shotgun that produces these four gliders at period 387.
        
        \begin{center}
        	\patternimglink{0.1}{exercise_herschel_tee_4_gliders}
        \end{center}
    
[Hint: Even though the first and third gliders are the same color, they can't be stored in the same loop because they're too close together.]
		\item Adjust the shotgun from (b) to build an armless $4$-consecutive-lane gun where the entire cycle repeats with period 129.  [Hint: 129*3 = 387, so add two more gliders to each of the p387 loops in the gun from (b).]
		\item Adjust the shotgun from (b) to build an armless $4$-consecutive-lane gun with the minimum repeat time of 87 ticks.  [Hint: $387+6 \times 8 = 435 = 87\times5$, so first adjust each loop to be 6fd bigger.]
% SOLUTIONS: patterns are posted at  https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=86064#p86064
		\item In a shotgun with one pair of loop guns per glider color, why can recipes consisting of gliders with alternate colors be stored more efficiently than consecutive gliders on the same colors?
% SOLUTION: Signals in a single loop gun represent output gliders of a particular color. With current circuitry, these signals can't be placed any closer together than 74 ticks. But a glider of the other color is represented by a signal in a separate loop, so it can appear at any time, limited only by potential interference between gliders and tee insertion reactions.
		\item The "armless-tee" Cordership gun (Figure ??) has already been adjusted to close to its recipe's minimum repeat time of $2061$ ticks. What could be added to this gun to allow a repeat time of less than $2000$ ticks?
% SOLUTION: Add more loop guns -- same solution as in (b) above. Wherever a 74-tick limitation appears, move one of the gliders involved to a separate pair of loop guns.
		\item How could the repeat time be reduced \emph{without} increasing the number of loop guns?
% SOLUTION: There are some long stretches of same-color gliders in both salvos making up the Cordership glider-pair recipe. For the glider pairs that build blocks, there are alternate recipes (e.g., the mirror image of the current recipe) that can switch one or both gliders to a different color.
%Might not need a figure for this, but here's some RLE just in case. The left-side glider is a different color in these two recipes:
% x = 34, y = 9, rule = LifeHistory
% 4.2D23.2D$3.B2DB22.2DB$2.5B22.2B2C$.4B.3B18.4BCBC$3CB2.4B16.4B.CB$2BC

% ... and if you take the mirror image of the right-side recipe, both gliders change colors.

\begin{problem}\label{exer:slow_glider_pairs}
	In an "armless-tee" gun that produces pairs of colliding gliders, the gliders in the loop guns are synchronized in groups of four. Adjustments to the four gliders in a group can make a collision happen in a different place, or at a different time.
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\bf\color{ocre}(\alph*)]
        \item Find a case where a glider follows another glider by 74 ticks in the "armless-tee" Cordership gun. Then find the other three gliders that are synchronized with that glider, and delay all four gliders by one tick. What happens?
% SOLUTION: Most likely the recipe will still work, but one part of it will be constructed one tick more slowly than before. Occasionally, if the changed position causes a conflict with other gliders, the recipe will fail.
        \item Return the four gliders to their original positions, and instead of delaying all four gliders, advance them all by one tick.  What happens?
% SOLUTION: The other three gliders in the group will generally have much plenty of space in front of them, but the first glider's 74-tick spacing is a limiting factor that prevents that particular collision from occurring any sooner in the construction recipe. Attempting to advance the 74-tick following glider will cause a failure in the syringe conduit, the next time that glider attempts to pass through.
		\item Find the four gliders that collaborate to produce the southernmost block in the Cordership seed. How would you move those gliders to build the block two cells directly south of its current position, or one cell directly southeast or southwest?

% 	By using these reactions, we can create armless guns like those that we saw in Section~\ref{sec:armless}.
% 	
% 		\item Create a loop gun that feeds a Herschel into the reaction on the left and thus creates $2$ of the $3$ gliders needed in the tee collision on the right.
% 		
% 		\item Use two loop guns and the reactions above to create an armless gun that fires gliders on $4$ different (but not necessarily consecutive) lanes.
% 		
% 		\item Explain why we cannot use two loop guns and these reactions to create a faster version of the four-lane gun from Figure~\ref{fig:armless_4_lane_gun} (i.e., a gun that armlessly fires gliders on $4$ \emph{consecutive} lanes). Similarly, explain why we cannot use four loop guns with these reactions to create a faster version of the $2$-engine Cordership gun from Figure~\ref{fig:armless_cordership_gun} (i.e., one that uses only $17$ gliders in each loop instead of $51$).

\begin{problem}\label{exer:multicolor_armless}
    With fewer separate loops in a multicolor armless design, changing the period of the gun becomes somewhat simpler. (Review)
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\bf\color{ocre}(\alph*)]
		\item Adjust one of the loop guns in the multicolor-armless Cordership gun, to make it an even period. How does the period change when a second syringe-based splitter (syringe+NW31) is added to the loop? [Hint: Start by moving the outermost two Snarks a long distance away to make space.]
% SOLUTION: adding a syringe+NW31 component similar to the ones in the Cordership guns, will add 3 ticks (mod 8) to the period.  That is, if the gun period is N before adding a syringe+NW31, then after the addition it will be possible to adjust the new period to N+3.
		\item How many of these syringe+NW31s would have to be added to change the loop gun to a ``HashLife-friendly'' period -- e.g., period $2^{12} = 4,096$?
% SOLUTION: a chain of seven syringe+NW31s will allow for a p2603+7*3+8N gun, which can be adjusted to period 4096.
		\item Find an alternate reflector in the Stable Circuitry chapter % (TODO: link)
        that changes the period (mod 8) by 5, with the same repeat time. How many of these must be added to allow for a p4096 loop?
% SOLUTION: Use a CP +3 reflector from simeks' toolkit (TODO: find link).  Only one of these will be needed, because (2603 + 5 + 8N) mod 8 = 4096 mod 8.
        \item Optionally, make the exact same addition to the other three loop guns to produce a working p4096 Cordership gun.
