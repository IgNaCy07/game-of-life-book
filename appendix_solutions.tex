			\item The problem is that neighboring tiles might interact with each other in different ways even though individually they evolve the same. In particular, if the tile directly to the left of the two tiles displayed in this question has live cells on its rightmost edge, then that tile can interact in different ways with the block and the pre-block. We thus need \emph{two} rows of ``buffer'' dead cells around each cell that differs between the tiles.\\

			\item A forward-moving glider hits the switch engines at the front, transforming them into block-laying ones rather than ones that shoot gliders backward. \\

The middle-bottom cell in this ``u''-shaped region has at least $4$ live neighbors and thus cannot actually be part of a still life, which is a contradiction.

		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:pi_hassle}] One possibility is the following oscillator, called the \textbf{pi portraitor}\index{pi portraitor}, which was found by Robert Wainwright in 1984 or 1985. It uses four heavyweight emulators\index{heavyweight!emulator} that have been welded together to provide the domino sparks. \\[-0.6em]

		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:almost_snark}] Unfortunately, the block that the glider hits is moved up by $1$ cell, so any subsequent gliders will not trigger the same reaction. \\
		
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:traffic_jam}] One possibility is the following oscillator, which was found by Noam Elkies in 1994. It is currently the smallest known period~$50$ oscillator. \\[-0.6em]

		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:p4_oscillator}] Suppose that there is a single cell (which we will call X) that oscillates with period~$4$. There are two possibilities: either X has the same state (alive or dead) in $3$ consecutive phases and the other state in the fourth phase, or X has the same state for two consecutive phases and then the opposite state for the other two.
		
		To see that the first possibility cannot happen, suppose without loss of generality that X has the same state in generations $0$, $1$, $2$, and the opposite state in generation $3$. Since all other cells are either stable or oscillate with period~$2$, all of X's neighbors have the same state in generations~$0$ and~$2$. Since X itself also has the same state in generations~$0$ and~$2$, it must also have the same state in generations~$1$ and~$3$, which is a contradiction that shows it cannot oscillate at period~$4$.
		
		To see that the second possibility cannot happen, suppose without loss of generality that X is alive in generations~$0$ and~$1$, and dead in generations~$2$ and $3$. Since all other cells are either stable or oscillate with period~$2$, all of X's neighbors have the same state in generations~$1$ and~$3$. Since X is dead and born after generation~$3$, it must have exactly $3$ live neighbors at generation $3$, and thus at generation~$1$ as well. This contradicts the fact that X is alive at generation $1$ and then dies.\\

From left-to-right, these collisions produce nothing, nothing, nothing, a pi-heptomino, a (pre-)honey farm, and a shifted block. We saw the block-shifting and honey farm-producing collisions in this chapter, and the collision used by the Snark\index{Snark} is also the honey farm-producing type. We will see a use of the pi-producing collision in Figure~\ref{fig:syringe}.

			\item $5/3$
			
			\item The rank of the colliding glider in lane~7 is exactly $0$, so we can no longer break ties randomly when inserting gliders into the salvo, and instead we must be careful to break ties by first inserting gliders that are farther to the right along the lines of constant rank before inserting gliders that are to the left.
			
			\item The minimal value of $w$ is $7/9$, since this choice gives a rank of $0$ in lane $-7$. This time, we must break rank ties by first inserting gliders that are farther to the \emph{left} along lines of constant rank.
			
			\item In general, the lines of constant rank have slope $\frac{2w+1}{2w-1}$, so the largest possible slope is $23/5$ (when $w = 7/9$), and the smallest possible slope is $17/11$ (when $w = 7/3$). \\

			\item The period of the resulting glider loop is $232$, which we could have determined by noting that the original loop had period $216$ and this one has the Snarks each $1$~cell farther from each other diagonally, so the new period must be $216+4+4+4+4 = 232$.

			\item The loop stops working because its period, $252$, is not a multiple of $5$.
			
			\item We shorten the track along two parallel sides by $4$ cells to decrease the loop's period to $252 - 4 \times 8 = 220$, which is a multiple of $5$. Replacing the bottom p$4$ bumper with a p$5$ bumper then gives the following glider loop:

This usage of the middleweight emulator is called a \textbf{filter}---see Section~\ref{sec:filters}.\\

			\item A p$73$ following glider hits the re-forming block in a way that doesn't form the correct pi~heptomino (similar to part~(c)). Also, the two halves of the gun cannot be moved close enough together (the rows of eaters get in each other's way).\\

		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:stable_heisenburp_break_apart}] Travelling counter-clockwise from the glider that the ship makes, the stable circuits used are: a Bandersnatch, a Snark, and a syringe attached to an Lx200 conduit (as introduced in Exercise~\ref{exer:syringe_Lx200}). That Lx200 conduit duplicates the signal---its output Herschel rebuilds the ship while feeding a glider into the ``rectifier'' reflector from Exercise~\ref{exer:new_reflectors}, and its output glider is fed into two Snarks and the glider duplicator from Figure~\ref{fig:glider_duplicator}.\\
		
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:four_dir_silver_reflector}] Just change the rightmost block to an eater~1 to turn the final two-glider output into a three-glider output, as in the difference between Figures~\ref{fig:H_to_2G} and~\ref{fig:H_to_3G}.\\

	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0em]
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:binary_ruler_when_big}] Each bit that is stored in the binary register increases its bounding box by $6 \times 6$, except for the first few bits that are not right at the edge. Some trial and error and manipulation by hand shows that it takes $182$ bits for the bounding box to be $4{\thousep}000 \times 4{\thousep}000$ or larger, so it will take $1{\thousep}000$ more bits (i.e., $1{\thousep}182$ in total) for it to be $10{\thousep}000 \times 10{\thousep}000$ or larger.
		
		We are thus left with the question of how long it takes before the binary register stores the value $2^{1181}$. Each clock tick takes $2^{20}$ generations, and some investigation of APGsembly~\ref{alg:apgsembly_binary_ruler} reveals that it requires approximately $3 \times 2^{n+1}$ clock ticks to store $2^n$ in the binary register. It thus takes approximately $2^{20} \times 3 \times 2^{1115} = 3 \times 2^{1182}$ generations for the size of the bounding box to exceed $10{\thousep}000 \times 10{\thousep}000$ cells.\\
		
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:pi_calc_distant_merge}] This merge circuit corresponds to the \texttt{ITER6;Z} line of APGsembly. The reason that the merge circuit is so far west is that the \emph{next} state is \texttt{ITER11}, which is dozens of lines later in the APGsembly code.\\[3.2cm]

		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:universal_computation_derive_pi_series}] \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5em,label=\bf\color{ocre}(\alph*)]
			\item Just recall that the Taylor series for $\arctan(x)$ centered at $x = 0$ is
			\[
				\arctan(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} - \frac{x^7}{7} + \cdots,
			\]
			with this series representation being valid when $-1 \leq x \leq 1$. Since $\arctan(1) = \pi/4$ (by looking at a triangle with angles $\pi/4$, $\pi/4$, and $\pi/2$), we conclude that
			\[
				\frac{\pi}{4} = \arctan(1) = 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \cdots.
			\]
			Multiplying both sides of this equation by $4$ gives us the desired series.
			
			\item If we split up the terms in the series from part~(a) as suggested by the hint, we get
			\begin{align*}
				\pi & = (2 + 2) - \left(\frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{5} + \frac{2}{5}\right) - \cdots \\
				& = 2 + \left(2 - \frac{2}{3}\right) - \left(\frac{2}{3} - \frac{2}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{5} - \frac{2}{7}\right) - \cdots \\
				& = 2 + \left(\frac{4}{1\cdot 3} - \frac{4}{3\cdot 5} + \frac{4}{5\cdot 7} - \cdots\right),
			\end{align*}
			as desired. Note that regrouping the parentheses like we did does not change the value of the series, despite it only being conditionally convergent, since we did not change the \emph{order} of the terms.
			
			
			\clearpage
			
			
			\item Using summation notation now, the series from part~(b) can be written in the form
			\begin{align*}
				\pi & = 2 + \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{4(-1)^k}{(2k+1)(2k+3)} \\
				& = 2 + \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k\left(\frac{2}{(2k+1)(2k+3)}\right. \\
				& \qquad \qquad \qquad \ {} + \left.\frac{2}{(2k+1)(2k+3)}\right) \\
				& = 2 + \frac{2}{3} + \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k\left(\frac{2}{(2k+1)(2k+3)}\right. \\
				& \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad {} - \left.\frac{2}{(2k+3)(2k+5)}\right) \\
				& = 2 + \frac{2}{3} + \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k\frac{8}{(2k+1)(2k+3)(2k+5)},
			\end{align*}
			as desired.
			
			\item Every time we use this method of splitting the terms of the series into two copies of half of those terms, we extract one more term from the parentheses. The next few transformations of the series are as follows:
			\begin{align*}
				\pi & = 2 + \frac{2}{3} + \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{8(-1)^k}{(2k+1)(2k+3)(2k+5)} \\
				& = 2 + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{15} \\
				& \quad + \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{24(-1)^k}{(2k+1)(2k+3)(2k+5)(2k+7)} \\
				& = 2 + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{15} + \frac{12}{105} \\
				& \quad + \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{96(-1)^k}{(2k+1)(2k+3)(2k+5)(2k+7)(2k+9)}.
			\end{align*}
			In general, after we perform this procedure $m$ times, we get the series
			\begin{align*}
				\pi & = 2\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \frac{k!}{1\cdot 3 \cdots (2k+1)} \\
				& \quad + \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{4m!(-1)^k}{(2k+1)(2k+3)\cdots(2k+2m+1)}.
			\end{align*}
			The infinite sum above is an alternating series with decreasing terms, so it is no larger than its first term: $4m!/(1\cdot 3 \cdots (2m+1))$, which tends to $0$ as $m\rightarrow\infty$. It follows that
			\begin{align*}
				\pi & = 2\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \frac{k!}{1\cdot 3 \cdots (2k+1)} \\
				& \quad + \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{4m!(-1)^k}{(2k+1)(2k+3)\cdots(2k+2m+1)} \\
				& = 2\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{k!}{1\cdot 3 \cdots (2k+1)} + 0,
			\end{align*}
			as desired.
			
			\item This comes immediately from the fact that, for every integer $k \geq 1$, the $k$-th term in the series from part~(d) is $k/(2k+1)$ times the previous term. A bit more explicitly,
			\begin{align*}
				\frac{\pi}{2} & = 1 + \frac{1!}{3} + \frac{2!}{3\cdot 5} + \frac{3!}{3\cdot 5 \cdot 7} + \frac{4!}{3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9} + \cdots \\
				& = 1 + \frac{1}{3}\left(1 + \frac{2}{5} + \frac{2\cdot 3}{5 \cdot 7} + \frac{2\cdot 3\cdot 4}{5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9} + \cdots\right) \\
				& = 1 + \frac{1}{3}\left(1 + \frac{2}{5}\left(1 + \frac{3}{7} + \frac{3\cdot 4}{7 \cdot 9} + \cdots\right)\right) \\
				& = 1 + \frac{1}{3}\left(1 + \frac{2}{5}\left(1 + \frac{3}{7}\left(1 + \frac{4}{9} + \cdots\right)\right)\right).
			\end{align*}
			Multiplying through by $2$ then (finally!) gives exactly the desired series~\eqref{eq:pi_series}.\\
		\end{enumerate}
	
	
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:pi_calc_prove_correct}] We claim that if $p_n$, $q_n$, and $r_n$ denote the top-left, top-right, and bottom-left entries of $B_n$, respectively, then $p_n = 2n!$, $q_n = (2n+1)(2(n-1)! + q_{n-1})$ with $q_1 = 6$, and $r_n = 3\cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdots (2n+1)$. These claims can be proved by induction on $n$ (and we already demonstrated the $n = 1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ base cases in Section~\ref{sec:pi_calc}).
		
		With these formulas in hand, it suffices to expand the quantity
		\[
			2\left(1 + \frac{1}{3}\left( 1 + \frac{2}{5}\left( \cdots \left( 1 + \frac{n-1}{2n-1}\right)\right)\right)\right)
		\]
		and see that it equals $q_n/r_n$. To this end, we expand and get
		\[
			2\left(1 + \frac{1!}{3} + \frac{2!}{3\cdot 5} + \cdots + \frac{(n-1)!}{3\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdots (2n-1)}\right).
		\]
		A common denominator of this quantity is $3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdots (2n-1) = r_n/(2n+1)$. The corresponding numerator satisfies the recurrence relation $c_n = (2n-1)c_{n-1} + 2(n-1)!$ with $c_1 = 2$, so $c_n = q_n/(2n+1)$. The above quantity thus equals $(q_n/(2n+1))/(r_n/(2n+1)) = q_n/r_n$, as desired.\\

Furthermore, lane~16 is the \emph{only} one improved by \texttt{R2L16} -- all other lanes can be fired on more efficiently by \texttt{R2L25}.\\

			\item $17$.
			
			\item $23$ (plus any non-negative integer multiple of $17$, depending on the spacing specifics of the reader's construction, so other possible answers include $40$, and $57$, and so on).
			
			\item Repeating the method of part~(a) $m$ times lets us synthesize a blinker track that is $17m$ cells farther away than the track from Figure~\ref{fig:blinker_trail_synth}, and repeating the method of part~(b) $n$ times lets us synthesize a blinker track that is $23n$ cells farther away. The number of cells between these two blinker tracks is $17m - 23n$. Since $\mathrm{gcd}(17,23) = 1$, we know from B\'ezout's identity (Theorem~\ref{thm:linear_diophantine}) that for any spacing $c$ of our choosing, we can find positive integers $m$ and $n$ so that $17m - 23n = c$.
			
			\item Use two copies of configuration from Figure~\ref{fig:blinker_trail_synth} on the same pair of blinker tracks. In one of them, move the forward rake back by $13\times 34$ generations, which makes the synthesized blinker trail $13 \times 17 = 221$ cells farther away. In the other one, insert $11 \times 2$ extra rephasers on each track, which makes the synthesized blinker trail $11 \times 23 = 253$ cells farther away. The spacing between these tracks is $253 - 221 = 32$ cells, as desired.\\
		\end{enumerate}
	

		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:caterpillar_helix_when_minimal}] $p = 3$, $q = 7$ works. The smallest positive integers in this case are $m = 11$ and $n = 19$, which is what Equation~\eqref{eq:orth_helix_parameters} gives. The trick is to realize that the values of $m$ and $n$ are pushed up when $p/q$ is close to the $1/2$ speed limit---in particular, when $q - 2p = 1$.\\
		
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:caterpillar_glider_slopes}] Backward gliders: $113/45$ (since over the course of 180 generations, the pi-heptominoes and glider separate by $45$ cells in the $x$-direction and $4 \times 17 + 45 = 113$ cells in the $y$-direction.
		
		Forward gliders: $23/45$ by the same calculation, but with the $y$-displacement being $4 \times 17 - 45 = 23$ cells.\\
		
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:waterbear_what_slope}] $56/95$. The slope is the slope between the input and output gliders of the $(23,5)c/79$ reaction, not the slope that the Herschel moves at.\\
		
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:waterbear_one_more_helix_component}] The reflector from Figure~\ref{fig:helix_reflect} does not have the correct timing---we would need to combine it with other components like the glider-shifting component from Figure~\ref{fig:helix_shift}, thus increasing the total xWSS cost. The adjustable reflector from Exercise~\ref{exer:backward_helix} is too long and slow (i.e., its output glider is too far behind its input glider).\\
		
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:waterbear_why_loaf}] It serves the same purpose as the glider duplicators in the caterpillar. Since the period of the helix is $2 \times 79$, not $79$ itself, a single copy of the helix only produces half as many gliders as are needed to support the track of Herschels. The loaf fills this gap---it carries the Herschel along in the exact same way that a glider does.\\
		
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:caterloopillar_front_end_glider}] The backward glider is used at the front end of the caterloopillar to synthesize the unidirectional glider synthesis seed. Since the loaf-pulling and loaf-pushing flotillae themselves only release forward gliders, they need help to form the seed that they collide into.\\
		
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:helix_components_from_caterloopillar}] The 3-xWSS component from Exercise~\ref{exer:backward_helix} reflects near its front and thus can be used to create much faster helices than the 2-xWSS component from Figure~\ref{fig:caterloopillar_front_back}. Helices made from that slower component can be sped up by adding additional copies of the 2-xWSS glider shifter from Figure~\ref{fig:helix_shift}, but doing so typically makes the helix much larger (and thus more expensive to construct).\\
		
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:caterloopillar_lonely_lwss}] It creates a seed for back half of caterloopillar (which is then used to construct the forward-moving loaf-pushing ships).\\
		
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:34_7c_156_with_blocks}] \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5em,label=\bf\color{ocre}(\alph*)]
			\item \raisebox{-\height+0.5em}{\patternimglink{0.087}{34_7c_156_herschel_climber_block}}\\[0.3em]
			
			\item The block-based Herschel climber might be easier to use since the blocks can be synthesized at essentially any time, whereas the gliders in the glider-based Herschel climber have to show up at exactly the right time. Also, the Herschel travelling on a block trails gives two output gliders that can be used for syntheses rather than just one. However, the glider-based Herschel climber might be easier to use since it just requires one glider per period (i.e., $156$ generations) instead of two to synthesize the block.
			
			Overall, it is probably easier to build a spaceship from the block-based track, as the timing constraint probably requires extra kickbacks reactions and/or other circuitry to get around that would be more expensive than the single extra glider needed to synthesize a block.\\
		\end{enumerate}
	
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:make_self_support_need_helix}] The $(13,1)c/31$ and $(27,1)c/72$ crawlers from Figures~\ref{fig:13_1c_31_b_heptomino_climber} and~\ref{fig:27_1c_72_herschel_climber} require helices, since they travel faster than $c/4$ in one of the orthogonal directions. The $(34,7)c/156$ crawler from Figure~\ref{fig:34_7c_156_herschel_climber} does not require a helix since it travels slower than $c/4$ in both directions, so the front-end of a self-supporting spaceship based on it can be supported more easily by forward gliders.\\
		
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:13_1c_31_helix_large}] \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5em,label=\bf\color{ocre}(\alph*)]
			\item We want the helix to travel at a speed of at least $13c/31$ in one of the directions. In the notation of the speed~\eqref{eq:oblique_speed_helix}, this means that we want
			\[
				\frac{10k + 10m + 20}{20k + 20m + 101} \geq 13/31.
			\]
			Solving for $k+m$ gives $k + m \geq \lceil 693/50 \rceil = 14$, so at least $2 \times 14 + 2 + 3 = 33$ xWSSes are needed to build this helix ($2 \times 14 = 28$ xWSSes for the glider-shifting components, and $2 + 3 = 5$ for the two reflecting ends).%This is valid because the 10/20 mover is the fastest component, so helix is made fastest by repeating it (not repeating ends, for example).
			
			\item Suppose that $k + m = 14$, as suggested in part~(a). We can adjust its speed by adding $\ell$ cells of free glider travel time, and by delaying the glider duplicator by $n$ generations. In one of the directions, the helix then has a speed of $(10 \times 14 + \ell + 20)c/(20 \times 14 + n + 4\ell + 101) = 13c/31$. However, this equation has no positive integer solutions (it is equivalent to $21\ell + 13n = 7$), so no helix of this speed exists.
			
			\item To construct such a helix with $61$~xWSSes, we can set $k = m = n = 14$, and have a glider travel $\ell = 25$ cells uninterrupted in one of the directions (but $0$ cells uninterrupted in the other direction). The resulting helix has speed
			\begin{align*}
				\frac{(10k + 10m + \ell + 20, 13k - 13m + \ell)c}{20k + 20m + n + 4\ell + 101} = \frac{(13,1)c}{31},
			\end{align*}
			as desired.

			\item The ends can be squeezed together $509$ full diagonals ($508$ more than in part~(a)), for a speed of $(1024,5120)c/33695514$.\\

		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:gemini_slope_n_fixed}] Mathematically, we are being asked which positive integers $p$ and $q$ are such that $p/q = (m+2048) / (m-2048)$ for some integer $m \geq 3072$. When $m = 3072$, we get a slope of $5$, and increasing $m$ decreases the slope. Furthermore, solving for $m$ in terms of $p$ and $q$ gives $m = 2048(p+q)/(p-q)$. It follows that the attainable slopes $p/q$ are exactly those between $1$ and $5$ (and by reflection of the Geminoid, between $1/5$ and $1$) for which $2048(p+q)/(p-q)$ is an integer (i.e., for which $p-q$ is a divisor of $2048(p+q)$).\\
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:single_lane_glider_final_glider_explain}] The four-glider slow salvo that this single-lane sequence produces is a p2 slow salvo, so the timing of the perpendicular gliders that we fire matters mod~$2$.\\
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:0degree_hand_move}] $-12$.\\
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:scorbie_splitter_slow_salvo}] $147$ gliders.\\
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:slow_demonoid_adjust}] If we bring the ends of the demonoid $n$ cells closer together, its period decreases to $2^{21} - 8n$ and its speed increases to $128c/(2^{21} - 8n)$. If we squeeze the ends $n = 62379$ cells closer together, its bounding box will have size $200{\thousep}000 \times 199{\thousep}950$, its period will be $1{\thousep}598{\thousep}120$, and is speed will be $128c/1598120 = 16c/199765$.\\
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:44hd_elbow_push}] \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5em,label=\bf\color{ocre}(\alph*)]
			\item Since we can insert a few copies of this recipe into the Demonoid without actually increasing its size or period, its new speed is simply $194c/2097152 = 97c/1048576$.
			
			\item Only $2/3$ of the 44hd block pushes are being used to advance from the current construction site (i.e., the current Scorbie splitter) to the next construction site (i.e., the next Scorbie splitter). The remaining $1/3$ of these block pushes are being used to build the Snark \emph{after} that next Scorbie splitter, but we still can't use the next construction site until these additional $1/3$ of the block-pushing gliders are safely out of the way.
			
			\item The mysterious $(4/3)88$ term in the denominator comes from the fact that gliders cannot start using the next construction site (i.e., the next Scorbie splitter) until the return glider in the Snarkbreaker makes its way backward past that construction site. If we use an extra $n$ 44hd block pushes in the Demonoid, then it will take $88n$ generations for gliders to go from the current construction site (i.e., the current Scorbie splitter) to the final Snark that is constructed, and another $(1/3)88n$ generations for the return glider to get past the next construction site, allowing it to be used. Altogether, this adds $(4/3)88n$ generations to the period of the Demonoid that consists of just empty space along the glider recipe's trail.\\[-0.3em]
			
			\item $\displaystyle\frac{(2/3)22c}{2009 + (4/3)88} = \frac{44c}{6379}$.\\
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:why_scorbie_splitter_snarkmakers}] The Scorbie splitter is about 150--200 lanes off to the side of the single-channel glider recipe (coming from the northwest), so zero-degree recipes would be very expensive (and not already located in pre-existing recipe databases, which only cover up to about 100 lane offsets).\\

		\item[\bf\color{ocre}\sffamily\ref{exer:life_like_almost_rro}] Even though two copies of this oscillator can be placed in the same loop so as to create a period $272/2 = 136$ oscillator, the two copies interact with each other by suppressing each other's sparks. For example, they suppress each other's dot sparks at generation~$20$.\\
